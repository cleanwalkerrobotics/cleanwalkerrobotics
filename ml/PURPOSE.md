# ml — Purpose

Machine learning models for perception, locomotion, and training pipelines.

**Owner:** cw-research
**What belongs here:** YOLO perception models, locomotion RL/PPO policies, training scripts, dataset configs, model weights, proof-of-concept experiments.
**What does NOT belong here:** Web demos (→ apps/web/), firmware integration (→ firmware/), research papers (→ docs/research/).
**Key constraint:** Model weights in `weights/` are git-ignored. Training configs should be reproducible.
