## Blockers & Risks

| # | Item | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|------|----------|------------|
| 1 | No GPU for Isaac Sim training | Medium | $6 on Vast.ai — needs Maurits approval or auto-spend decision |
| 2 | BEEAH duplicate emails (~20x) | Low | Apology sent. Monitoring for reply. May have damaged credibility. |
| 3 | Zero inbound replies | Expected | Day 2 of outreach. Follow-up cadence starts Day 4 (Feb 15). |
