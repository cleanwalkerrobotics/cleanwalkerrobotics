# Grant Research — Additional Programs Analysis

**Compiled:** 2026-02-10
**Team:** cw-bizdev
**Scope:** Innovate UK, NWO, DARPA, EIT Climate-KIC, Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe Cluster 4, Innosuisse, NRC IRAP, NSF/EPA non-SBIR, XPRIZE, Bloomberg Mayors Challenge

**Companion document:** See `docs/ceo/grant-opportunities.md` for full analysis of EIC Accelerator, WBSO, Innovatiekrediet, MIT Haalbaarheid, VFF, DOT SMART, SBIR/STTR, Singapore programs, UAE programs, and all multilateral development bank programs (World Bank, IDB, ADB, GEF, USAID).

---

## Executive Summary

This document researches additional grant/funding programs beyond those already analyzed in `grant-opportunities.md`. The findings reinforce the existing strategy: **Netherlands (WBSO, MIT, VFF) and UAE (MBRIF, DFA) remain the highest-priority funding paths.** The newly researched programs are mostly blocked by geographic eligibility requirements (UK-only, Swiss-only, Canadian-only, US academic-only) or structural mismatches (defense focus, academic-only, too-large consortia).

**One notable new finding:** Horizon Europe Cluster 4 has a specific 2026 robotics call (HORIZON-CL4-2026-05-DIGITAL-EMERGING-03) with a deadline of April 15, 2026, but it requires a consortium and €12-13M project budgets — not viable for a solo founder.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Innovate UK Smart Grants

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Innovate UK Smart Grants |
| **Administering body** | UKRI / Innovate UK |
| **Funding** | Typically up to £2M per project |
| **Status** | **PAUSED since January 2025** — being replaced with "tailored support" and new pilot programs |
| **Eligibility** | UK-registered companies only; all project work must occur in the UK |

**Our fit: 1/10**

**Disqualifying issues:**
1. Smart Grants are paused — no new competitions since Jan 2025
2. Only UK-registered companies can apply — we have no UK entity
3. All project activities must take place in the UK
4. Even when operational, international partners could participate but would NOT receive Innovate UK funding

**Innovate UK "Physical AI" note:** Innovate UK Business Connect promotes the EIC Advanced Innovation Challenges, including the Physical AI pilot. This is the same EIC program already analyzed in `grant-opportunities.md` (Section 1.2) — not a separate Innovate UK program.

**International collaboration:** Innovate UK does offer bilateral collaboration calls (UK-Japan, UK-Israel, etc.) but these require a UK lead partner and the non-UK partner must justify how their involvement accelerates UK economic growth.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable. Would need a UK entity (est. £100-500 for Ltd company + compliance costs). Only consider if establishing UK presence for market reasons.

---

### 2. NWO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research)

#### 2.1 NWO Take-off

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | NWO Take-off (Phase 1: Feasibility Studies; Phase 2: Early-Stage Routes) |
| **Administering body** | NWO / ZonMw |
| **Phase 1** | €30,000-€60,000 grant (max 6 months) |
| **Phase 2** | €50,000-€450,000 loan (repayable over 8 years, max 24 months) |
| **2026 applications** | Rolling (Phase 1 opened January 2026); Phase 2 spring round open in January |
| **Total Phase 1 budget** | €4.5M for 2026 |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Critical eligibility issue:** Take-off is specifically for commercializing research from Dutch knowledge institutions — universities (WO), universities of applied sciences (HBO), and applied research organizations (TO2). The startup must originate from academic research.

CleanWalker does not originate from a Dutch university or research institute. We are an independent startup. This is a **structural disqualifier**.

**Workaround:** If we were to establish a formal research collaboration with a Dutch university (e.g., TU Delft robotics lab, TU Eindhoven), a jointly-founded spinout could potentially qualify. This would require significant effort and IP negotiation.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable in current form. If we ever partner with a Dutch university for R&D, revisit.

---

#### 2.2 NWO AiNed Programme

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | AiNed — National Growth Fund Programme for AI |
| **Budget** | €204.5M from National Growth Fund |
| **Administering body** | NWO, funded by Ministry of Economic Affairs |
| **Sub-programmes** | Fellowship Grants, ELSA Labs, AiNed XS Europe |

**Our fit: 2/10**

AiNed is primarily an academic research program. Its sub-programmes fund:
- **Fellowship Grants:** Attract AI researchers to Dutch universities — not for startups
- **ELSA Labs:** Research on ethical/legal/societal aspects of AI — academic
- **AiNed XS Europe:** Small exploratory AI research grants for researchers

**Goal:** "The number of SMEs developing or adopting AI has doubled" — but this flows indirectly through ecosystem effects, not direct grants to companies.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable. Already noted as fit 2/10 in `grant-opportunities.md`.

---

#### 2.3 NWO Venture Challenge

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | NWO Venture Challenge Programme |
| **Budget** | €200,000 total for 2026 (both spring and fall rounds combined) |
| **Deadlines** | Spring: February 3, 2026 (passed); Fall: July 2, 2026 |
| **Eligibility** | Research-based startups |

**Our fit: 3/10**

The Venture Challenge is a very small program (€200K total across all participants) focused on research-based startups. It provides entrepreneurship training rather than significant funding.

**Recommendation:** Marginal value even if eligible. The July 2 fall round deadline exists but program budget is tiny and academic-origin focus likely applies.

---

### 3. DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Administering body** | US Department of Defense |
| **Funding mechanism** | BAAs (Broad Agency Announcements), contracts, SBIR/STTR |
| **Relevant programs** | RACER (off-road autonomy), OFFSET (swarm tactics) |
| **Eligibility** | Prime contractor must be >50% US-owned |

**Our fit: 0/10**

**Multiple disqualifying issues:**
1. **Defense focus:** All DARPA programs serve national security objectives. Litter collection robots have no defense application.
2. **US ownership:** Prime contractors must be >50% US-owned. We are Dutch-founded.
3. **SBIR expired:** DARPA SBIR/STTR (the main small business funding mechanism) is expired since Sep 2025 along with all federal SBIR programs.
4. **Security clearance:** Many DARPA programs involve classified or export-controlled technology.
5. **No relevant open calls:** Current robotics programs (RACER, OFFSET) focus on military UGVs and swarm tactics, not commercial service robots.

**DARPA Robotics Challenge context:** The famous DRC (2012-2015) that produced many quadrupedal robot advances (Boston Dynamics, etc.) was a one-time challenge. No 2026 equivalent exists.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable. Do not pursue.

---

### 4. EIT Climate-KIC

#### 4.1 Catalyse NEB 2026

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | EIT Community NEB Accelerator: Catalyse NEB 2026 |
| **Type** | Startup accelerator |
| **Funding** | €22,000 cash + business support services |
| **Eligibility** | EU/Associated Country, incorporated after Jan 1 2021, min €15K 2025 revenue, TRL/BRL 4+, founders >50% shares, max €1M total raised |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Blockers:**
- Requires minimum €15,000 revenue in 2025 — we are pre-revenue
- TRL 4 minimum — we are at TRL 2-3
- €22K funding is very small relative to our needs

**Recommendation:** Not applicable due to revenue requirement. Even if eligible, funding is too small.

---

#### 4.2 ClimAccelerator 2026

**Not applicable.** This is a call for Entrepreneurship Support Organisations (ESOs) to run accelerator programs — not for startups themselves.

---

### 5. Digital Europe Programme

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL) |
| **Administering body** | European Commission (HaDEA) |
| **Focus** | Supercomputing, AI, cybersecurity, advanced digital skills, EDIHs |
| **Relevant 2026 calls** | EDIH network consolidation (deadline March 3, 2026), Data Spaces |

**Our fit: 2/10**

The Digital Europe Programme primarily funds:
- European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) — organizations that help SMEs adopt digital technologies, not direct startup grants
- Large-scale infrastructure projects (AI testing facilities, supercomputing access)
- Skills academies (ELEVATE)

**No direct startup grant mechanism** in the Digital Europe Programme. SMEs benefit indirectly through EDIH services (e.g., free access to AI testing infrastructure).

**Potential indirect value:** Find our nearest EDIH with robotics expertise and use their (free/subsidized) testing facilities.

**Recommendation:** Not a funding source. Find local EDIH for potential subsidized services. See [EU EDIH catalogue](https://european-digital-innovation-hubs.ec.europa.eu/edih-catalogue).

### 6. Horizon Europe Cluster 4 — Robotics Call 2026

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Call ID** | HORIZON-CL4-2026-05-DIGITAL-EMERGING-03 |
| **Full name** | Apply AI: Next-Generation Agile and Intelligent Robotics Platforms for Industrial and Service Applications |
| **Type** | Research and Innovation Action (RIA) |
| **Budget** | €25M total (2 projects of €12-13M each) |
| **Opening** | January 15, 2026 |
| **Deadline** | **April 15, 2026** |
| **Partnership** | AI, Data and Robotics Partnership |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**This is the closest Horizon Europe call to our domain**, targeting:
- Modular, interoperable robotic platforms
- Industrial and **service** applications (public spaces could fit)
- Safety, trust, human-centred design
- Open to SMEs and startups

**However, critical blockers:**
1. **Consortium required:** RIA calls require minimum 3 entities from 3 EU/Associated countries
2. **Project scale:** €12-13M per project — orders of magnitude beyond our capacity
3. **We'd be a minor partner:** Even in a consortium, we'd be a small contributor (5-10% of budget)
4. **April 15 deadline:** Impossible to form a consortium in 2 months without existing relationships
5. **Application effort:** 200-400 hours for a consortium proposal
6. **Success rate:** ~12-15% for Cluster 4 calls

**Related calls (same deadline):**
- HORIZON-CL4-2026-01-MAT-PROD-45: Pilot access schemes to Technology Infrastructures for startups/SMEs (CSA, €1.5-2.5M per project for 2 projects)
  - This funds organizations that provide access to testing facilities for startups — not direct startup grants

**Recommendation:** Not viable as lead or independent applicant. Only relevant if invited to join a consortium led by a major robotics institute (e.g., Fraunhofer, CEA, TU Delft). Keep on radar for 2027-2028 calls when we have a working prototype and established academic partnerships.

---

### 7. Innosuisse (Switzerland)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Innosuisse — Swiss Innovation Agency |
| **Type** | Startup Innovation Projects |
| **Funding** | Up to 70% of eligible project costs |
| **Eligibility** | Swiss-registered and headquartered companies only |

**Our fit: 0/10**

**Disqualifying:** Requires Swiss incorporation, Swiss headquarters, and registration in the Swiss commercial registry. Company must be <5 years old and pre-market.

Switzerland has an excellent robotics ecosystem (ETH Zurich, EPFL, ABB), but access requires Swiss entity establishment.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable. Only consider if establishing Swiss presence for market reasons (extremely unlikely given our NL/UAE/SG strategy).

---

### 8. NRC IRAP (Canada)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | National Research Council Industrial Research Assistance Program |
| **Funding** | Varies; up to $1M+ for larger projects |
| **Eligibility** | Canadian-incorporated, profit-oriented SMEs with ≤500 FTE |

**Our fit: 0/10**

**Disqualifying:** Requires Canadian incorporation and operations. International collaboration exists but only for Canadian companies partnering internationally — not for foreign companies accessing Canadian funds.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable.

---

### 9. US Federal (NSF, EPA, DOE) — Non-SBIR

#### 9.1 NSF (National Science Foundation)

**All major NSF programs (Trailblazer, NRI, AI Research Institutes) require US-based academic institutions as primary applicants.** Companies can participate as sub-awardees or partners but cannot lead proposals. The Trailblazer program (up to $3M) is for individual investigators at US universities.

**Fit: 0/10** — Not applicable for foreign companies.

#### 9.2 EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)

EPA's primary mechanism for small business innovation is SBIR, which faces the same issues:
- **Authorization expired** September 30, 2025
- **51% US ownership requirement** when/if reauthorized
- EPA SBIR has funded relevant companies (CleanRobotics for AI-powered trash sorting, KLAW Industries for autonomous recycling sorting) — showing thematic alignment but structural ineligibility

EPA's Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grants ($275M from Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) go to political subdivisions, not companies.

**Fit: 0/10** — Not applicable.

#### 9.3 DOE / ARPA-E

ARPA-E focuses exclusively on energy technologies. FY2026 plans include 4 new focused solicitations on energy production. No waste management, environmental cleanup, or service robotics programs.

**Fit: 0/10** — Not applicable (wrong technology domain).

---

### 10. Competitions and Challenges

#### 10.1 XPRIZE

**Active XPRIZE competitions (2026):**
- **XPRIZE Wildfire** ($11M): Autonomous wildfire detection + suppression. Finals in 2026. Not relevant (wrong domain).
- **XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion**: Alternative protein. Not relevant.
- **XPRIZE Quantum**: Quantum computing applications. Not relevant.
- **XPRIZE Carbon Removal**: Carbon dioxide removal. Not relevant.

**No active XPRIZE for waste management, urban cleaning, or service robotics.**

CleanRobotics (AI trash sorting) was a semifinalist in XPRIZE's AI competition, showing the concept could fit future challenges.

**Fit: 0/10** (no current relevant competition)

**Recommendation:** Monitor xprize.org for future waste/urban sustainability challenges.

---

#### 10.2 Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Prize** | $1M per winning city (25 cities in Jan 2026) |
| **Applicants** | Cities/municipal governments only |
| **Themes** | Municipal service reimagination (including waste management) |
| **2025 cycle** | 50 finalists from 630 applications, 33 countries |

**Our fit: N/A (not a company grant)**

Nearly half of African applicant cities proposed waste management upgrades. This signals strong municipal demand for our technology.

**Strategic value:** If a city partner wins a Bloomberg challenge with a waste management proposal featuring our robot, that's a funded pilot. This is an indirect pathway — position CleanWalker as a technology partner for Bloomberg-supported cities.

**Recommendation:** Not a direct funding source. Use as a signal of municipal demand in pitch materials.

---

#### 10.3 Ecoembes Innovation Challenge 2026

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Organizer** | Ecoembes (Spain) via The Circular Lab |
| **Prize** | €2,000 |
| **Deadline** | January 31, 2026 (closed) |
| **Focus** | Waste management innovation |

**Our fit: 3/10 (if it were still open)**

Prize is tiny (€2,000) and deadline has passed. Not worth pursuing even in future cycles unless prize increases significantly.

## Key Insight from This Research

**The most important finding is negative:** the programs most commonly associated with robotics/AI innovation funding (DARPA, NSF, Innovate UK, Innosuisse) are all blocked by geographic/entity requirements or structural mismatches. This confirms that our existing strategy — focusing on Netherlands (WBSO, MIT, VFF, Innovatiekrediet), EU (EIC), and UAE (MBRIF, DFA, ADIO) — is correct.

**The only new actionable item** from this research is exploring the EU's European Digital Innovation Hub network for subsidized robotics testing services (not funding, but in-kind support).
