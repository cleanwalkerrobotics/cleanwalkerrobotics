**Subject:** CleanWalker Robotics — Urban Mobile Robotics programme, upcoming open calls?

**Body:**

Hi Aleksis,

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. I'm writing to you about the Urban Mobile Robotics programme at Forum Virium Helsinki.

We're building the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot — AI-powered detection trained on 25,000+ litter images, all-terrain four-legged locomotion for parks, waterfronts, and mixed surfaces, and a bag cassette system that integrates with existing municipal collection routes. Think of it as the complement to Trombia's autonomous sweeper: not sweeping streets, but detecting and picking up individual litter items on terrain where wheeled machines can't operate.

I understand the first UMR open call closed in December 2025. Is there a Round 2 planned, or another way to participate in the programme? We've prepared a full application and pilot proposal for Helsinki — including proposed deployment zones at Jätkäsaari, Esplanadi, and Kalasatama — and would be ready to move quickly if there's an opportunity.

I'd welcome a brief call to discuss how CleanWalker could fit into the UMR programme's goals. Happy to share our technical specs and pilot plan.

Best regards,
Maurits Bos
Founder & CEO, CleanWalker Robotics
