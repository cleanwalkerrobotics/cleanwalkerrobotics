**Why they matter:** The "Kader Schoon en Afvalvrij 2025-2028" framework (approved Dec 11, 2024) is Amsterdam's new policy for keeping the city clean and waste-free.

2. Parallel connection request to Dennis Wasch (innovation angle) for internal advocacy
3. Do NOT cold-email Wethouder van Buren — work through civil servants first, escalate politically only if needed
