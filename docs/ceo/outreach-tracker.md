## Expansion Pipeline — 10 High-Potential Targets

### EU Municipalities (Smart City Leaders)

| # | Company | Contact Role | Why They're a Good Fit | Est. Annual Cleaning Budget | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|-------|
| 4 | City of Copenhagen | Copenhagen Solutions Lab — Chief Consultant or Team Lead (Dept. of Climate & Urban Development) | "Green capital" brand. Solutions Lab tests smart city tech including waste management. ~200 street cleaners for 374km roads. Odense robotics cluster 1.5 hrs away. | DKK 2.6B total dept budget (~EUR 350M); street cleaning subset est. EUR 30-50M | Research | Contact page: cphsolutionslab.kk.dk/en/contact-us |
| 5 | City of Helsinki | Forum Virium Helsinki — Urban Mobile Robotics project lead / Stara (City Construction Services) | Most permissive EU robot regulations. Already piloted Trombia autonomous sweeper in Jätkäsaari (2021). "Testbed Helsinki" program actively seeks tech pilots. 1,200+ Stara staff. | Est. EUR 40-60M (city operations) | Research | Forum Virium has direct experience supporting robotics companies (GIM Robotics, Trombia, LMAD) into international markets. |
| 6 | City of Barcelona | Barcelona Smart City — Urban Services / Ecologia Urbana department | Smart City Expo World Congress host (Nov annually, 850+ city delegations). Sentilo IoT platform. Progressive tech adoption. Mediterranean climate = year-round outdoor litter problem. | Est. EUR 300-400M (waste + cleaning combined, large metro area) | Research | Smart City Expo Nov 2026 = opportunity to demo. Approach city innovation team first. |
| 7 | City of Vienna | MA48 (Abfallwirtschaft, Straßenreinigung und Fuhrpark) / Smart City Wien team | ICRA 2026 host city (Jun 1-5). MA48 swept 10,291 tons in 2023. Smart City Wien framework targets innovation through 2040. Strong public infrastructure. | Est. EUR 200-300M (MA48 total operations) | Research | ICRA attendance = perfect timing for Vienna outreach. Dual approach: MA48 for operations, Smart City Wien for innovation buy-in. |

### UAE/Gulf Property Management

| # | Company | Contact Role | Why They're a Good Fit | Est. Annual Facilities Budget | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------|-------|
| 8 | Emaar Properties (Dubai) | Ahmad Al Falasi — Group COO, Community & Facilities Management (900+ person team) | Manages Downtown Dubai, Dubai Mall surrounds, Dubai Marina, Arabian Ranches. Massive premium outdoor spaces that demand pristine presentation. ECM (Emaar Community Management) is award-winning division. | Est. AED 500M+ (USD 136M+) across all communities | Research | Premium communities = high willingness to pay for cutting-edge cleaning tech. Robot dog in Downtown Dubai = global PR story. |
| 9 | Majid Al Futtaim / Enova | Renaud Capris — CEO of Enova (Majid Al Futtaim + **Veolia** JV, est. 2002) | Enova is a joint venture between Majid Al Futtaim and **Veolia**. Manages malls, airports, healthcare, metros across MENAT. If we land Veolia as partner, Enova is an instant second channel. | Est. AED 1B+ (USD 272M+) across MENAT portfolio | Research | **Strategic:** Veolia JV means a Veolia partnership could unlock Enova automatically. Or approach Enova independently as Veolia back-channel. |

### Australian City Councils

| # | Company | Contact Role | Why They're a Good Fit | Est. Annual Cleaning Budget | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|-------|
| 10 | City of Sydney Council | Smart City / City Operations division | Smart city strategic framework with data-driven monitoring. Carbon-neutral targets. Veolia already operates in Sydney (Bondi Beach trial). Major parks: Hyde Park, Royal Botanic Gardens adjacent areas. | Est. AUD 50-80M (public space maintenance) | Research | Veolia ANZ angle: if Veolia partnership lands, Sydney Council is a natural pilot site. Approach after Veolia conversation. |
| 11 | City of Melbourne Council | Emerging Technology Testbed program / Smart City Office | Active Emerging Technology Testbed program that partners with industry for pilots. Already piloting 50 sensor-equipped smart bins + BigBelly compactors. Autonomous cleaning robots already appearing in Melbourne CBD. | Est. AUD 40-60M (public space maintenance) | Research | Melbourne's testbed program is designed exactly for products like ours. Strong innovation culture. Royal Botanic Gardens, Yarra River paths = ideal terrain. |

### US — Universities & Theme Parks

| # | Company | Contact Role | Why They're a Good Fit | Est. Annual Facilities Budget | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------|-------|
| 12 | University of Texas at Austin | VP of Campus Operations / Facilities Services Director | Largest US university campus (431 acres). Austin is already our US pilot city target. FY2026 budget includes $53.8M increase. 51,000+ students = massive litter generation. Controlled private property = fewer regulatory hurdles than public streets. | Est. USD 150-200M (total facilities operations) | Research | University campuses are ideal early deployments: controlled environment, visible impact, tech-forward culture. UT has an active robotics department too (credibility partner). |
| 13 | Walt Disney Parks & Resorts | Environmental Sustainability / Park Operations — VP level | Zero waste to landfill goal by 2030. Obsessive about park cleanliness (1 cast member per ~100 guests on litter duty). 4 US parks + international. Sustainable design standards across all new projects. Would pay premium for brand-aligned autonomous solution. | Est. USD 500M+ (parks facilities/operations across WDW alone) | Research | Disney = ultimate credibility customer. If our robot works at Magic Kingdom, it works anywhere. Long sales cycle but transformative reference. Theme park terrain (paths, lawns, plazas) = perfect for quadruped. |
