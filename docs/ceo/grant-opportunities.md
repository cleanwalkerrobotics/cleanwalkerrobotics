# Grant Opportunities — CleanWalker Robotics

Last updated: 2026-02-10

## Company Profile (for eligibility assessment)

- **Entity:** MB Software Studio LLC (US-type LLC, Dutch founder, NL-based operations)
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue, digital prototype only (ML model, simulation, CAD — no physical robot)
- **Team:** Solo founder + AI tooling
- **Needs:** ~$363K to reach pilot stage
- **Legal note:** US LLC is classified as equivalent to a Dutch BV for Dutch tax purposes since Jan 1, 2025. This makes us subject to Dutch corporate income tax but may enable access to Dutch R&D incentives. For EU grants, our NL establishment qualifies us as an EU-based SME. Converting to a Dutch BV would remove all ambiguity.

| **Minimum blended finance** | €1M (increased from €500K in 2025) |
| **Total 2026 budget** | €414M |
| **Deadlines** | Bimonthly cut-offs: Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov 2026 |
| **Eligibility** | SMEs established in EU Member State or Associated Country |
| **TRL requirement** | TRL 6-8 (validated in relevant environment) for development; TRL 9 for scale-up |

**Our fit: 5/10**

**What we meet:**
- NL-based entity (LLC treated as BV equivalent for EU purposes)
- Deep-tech innovation (robotics + AI + environmental)
- Clear global scale-up ambition
- Open to any technology field — litter-collecting robots qualify

**What we don't meet:**
- TRL 6-8 requirement — we are at TRL 2-3 (concept + ML model, no physical prototype)
- "Financial maturity" valued — we are pre-revenue with no prior funding rounds
- Physical prototype expected at this stage

**Application effort:** 80-120 hours (short proposal + full proposal + interview if shortlisted)

**Strategic value:** Massive credibility boost. EIC portfolio companies get Business Acceleration Services, investor connections, and procurement introductions to EU municipalities. Would instantly validate the company.

**Recommendation:** Not ready now. Target for Q1-Q2 2027 after building a TRL 4-5 prototype.

### 1.2 EIC Advanced Innovation Challenge — Physical AI

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | EIC Advanced Innovation Challenge: Physical AI |
| **Administering body** | European Innovation Council |
| **Funding** | €300,000 (Stage 1); higher amounts for Stage 2 |
| **TRL requirement** | TRL 4 minimum (prototype tested in lab) |
| **Target TRL** | TRL 6-7 by end of Stage 2 |

**Three application domains:**
1. Disaster response and civil security physical agents
2. Autonomous labs for scientific discovery
3. **Personal or professional robot assistants** ← our best fit

**Requirements:**
- Initial prototype tested in laboratory conditions
- Access to infrastructure for data collection and testing
- A challenging use case formulated by a potential end-user, supported by a letter of intent
- Mandatory 1 person-month for workshops and demos

**Our fit: 6/10**

**What we meet:**
- "Professional robot assistant" framing fits an autonomous litter-collecting robot
- ML model and simulation work show R&D capability
- Lower TRL bar (TRL 4 vs TRL 6 for main Accelerator)
- NL-based entity qualifies

**What we don't meet:**
- Need "initial prototype tested in laboratory conditions" — we have no physical prototype
- Need a letter of intent from an end-user or robotics integrator
- Environmental/waste collection is NOT explicitly listed (domains focus on disaster response, labs, personal assistants)

**Application effort:** 40-60 hours

**Strategic value:** €300K would fund our first physical prototype. The "Physical AI" branding aligns perfectly with our positioning. Access to EIC network of robotics integrators.

**Recommendation:** High priority target once we have a basic physical prototype (even a modified off-the-shelf quadruped with our ML model). Secure a letter of intent from a municipal partner first. Target: late 2026 or early 2027.

---

### 1.3 EIC Accelerator — Climate Adaptation Challenge

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | EIC Accelerator Challenge: Deep Tech for Climate Adaptation |
| **Budget** | €50M allocated |
| **Funding** | Up to €2.5M grant + equity |

**Scope focuses on:**
1. Urban heat mitigation (materials, coatings, cooling)
2. Climate-smart agriculture (crops, pest management)
3. Water scarcity solutions (filtration, reuse)
4. Flood/coastal protection (infrastructure, early warning)

**Our fit: 2/10**

Litter-collecting robots, waste management, and urban cleaning are **NOT within scope**. This challenge is narrowly focused on climate adaptation, not urban sustainability broadly. Do not apply.

---

### 1.4 Horizon Europe (2026-2027 Work Programme)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Horizon Europe Framework Programme |
| **Administering body** | European Commission (various Executive Agencies) |
| **Relevant clusters** | CL5 (Climate, Energy, Mobility), CL6 (Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources) |
| **Funding** | Typically €1-5M per project |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Key issues:**
- **Consortium required:** Minimum 3 independent entities from 3 different EU countries. We'd need to find 2+ partners.
- **No relevant open calls:** No 2026-2027 calls specifically target autonomous litter/waste collection robots
- **Closest call found:** HORIZON-CL5-2026-02-D4-01 — "On-site innovative robotic solutions for building renovation" — not relevant
- **Circular economy calls** (CL6) exist but focus on materials/textiles, not robotic waste collection
- **Application effort:** 200-400 hours for a consortium application
- **Success rate:** ~15% — extremely competitive

**Strategic value:** High prestige but disproportionate effort for a tiny team.

**Recommendation:** Skip for now. Revisit if we join a consortium led by a university or large company (e.g., if Veolia or a robotics institute invites us).

## REGION 2: NETHERLANDS

### 2.1 WBSO (Wet Bevordering Speur- en Ontwikkelingswerk)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Act for the Promotion of Research and Development Work |
| **Administering body** | RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency) |
| **Type** | R&D tax credit (payroll tax reduction) |
| **Benefit** | 32% reduction on first €350K of R&D wages; 16% above that |
| **Who can apply** | Companies subject to Dutch payroll tax (inhoudingsplichtige) OR self-employed persons (zelfstandigen) performing R&D |
| **Deadlines** | Three application periods per year; must apply before R&D work starts for each period |
| **Legal entity** | BV, NV, eenmanszaak, VOF all eligible. LLC treated as BV equivalent since Jan 2025 |
| **R&D must occur** | Within the EU |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- Our ML training, simulation work, hardware design, and firmware development all qualify as S&O (research and development)
- LLC is treated as BV equivalent for Dutch tax purposes
- Pre-revenue companies can benefit (it's a tax credit, not dependent on profit)
- Self-employed persons (IB-ondernemers) can also claim a fixed deduction

**What we don't meet / risks:**
- If founder has no salary from the LLC, the payroll tax reduction has no base to apply to
- Need to apply BEFORE the R&D period starts
- Must track R&D hours diligently (administration requirement)

**Application effort:** 8-16 hours per application (straightforward online form via eHerkenning)

**Strategic value:** Beyond the tax savings, WBSO approval is a recognized "quality mark" — it signals to investors and other grant bodies that your R&D is validated. Often a prerequisite for Innovatiekrediet.

**Recommendation:** **APPLY IMMEDIATELY.** This is the lowest-hanging fruit. Even if the immediate tax benefit is modest (depends on salary structure), the WBSO approval strengthens all future grant applications.

**URGENT: Next application window — check RVO.nl for 2026 Period 2 deadline (typically ~1 month before period starts)**

---

### 2.2 Innovatiekrediet (Innovation Credit)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Innovatiekrediet |
| **Administering body** | RVO |
| **Type** | Government-backed innovation loan (repayable if project succeeds) |
| **Funding** | €150K–€10M (technical projects); €150K–€5M (clinical) |
| **Interest** | 3.0% annual + 15% one-time markup |
| **Co-financing** | At least 55% from other sources required |
| **Legal entity** | No specific restriction to BV — must be NL-established company |
| **Application** | Year-round (rolling) |

**Conditions:**
1. Technically new product/process/service, new to the Netherlands
2. Substantial technical risk (not just commercial risk)
3. Company with substantial activities in NL
4. Market-ready outcome within 5 years
5. Prior proof-of-concept work demonstrating feasibility understanding
6. Clear development path
7. Complete financing plan (own capital + investors for the 55% co-financing)
8. Contingency reserves

**Our fit: 5/10**

**What we meet:**
- Highly innovative product (no commercial quadrupedal litter robot exists)
- Substantial technical risk (robotics + outdoor AI + manipulation)
- NL-based company
- Clear market opportunity documented in our research

**What we don't meet (yet):**
- Need proof-of-concept work (we only have digital/simulation work)
- Need 55% co-financing from other sources — at €363K total, we'd need ~$200K from investors
- Need documented financing discussions (term sheets, even unsigned)
- Need contingency reserves

**Application effort:** 40-80 hours (business plan, technical description, financial projections)

**Strategic value:** Favorable terms — the loan is only repayable if the project succeeds. If the prototype fails, the debt is forgiven. This is essentially risk-free funding.

**Recommendation:** Target for H2 2026, after securing some form of co-financing (even a small angel investment or letter of intent). Having WBSO approval first strengthens this application significantly.

### 2.3 MIT Haalbaarheidsprojecten (Feasibility Studies)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Mkb Innovatiestimulering Regio en Topsectoren — Haalbaarheidsprojecten |
| **Administering body** | Regional provinces (no longer RVO) |
| **Funding** | 35% of eligible costs, up to €20,000 max |
| **Duration** | Max 12 months |
| **Eligible costs** | Employee wages, external advisory, materials, equipment rental |
| **Application** | Regional — first-come, first-served (lottery on day 1 if oversubscribed) |
| **2026 opening** | April 8, 2026 (some regions); June 9–Sep 15, 2026 (South Holland) |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- SME conducting feasibility research
- Technical innovation (autonomous litter robot)
- Study into economic and technical feasibility is exactly what we need

**What we don't meet:**
- Budget typically exhausted on day one — need to be very fast
- Small amount (€20K max) — useful but not transformative

**Application effort:** 8-16 hours

**Strategic value:** Quick validation of concept. The €20K could fund external engineering consultation or a basic hardware feasibility study. Having MIT approval on record helps with later applications.

**Recommendation:** Apply on April 8, 2026 opening day. Prepare application in advance.

**URGENT: Application window opens April 8, 2026 — within 90 days!**

| **Administering body** | RVO |
| **MIA benefit** | 27%, 36%, or 45% of investment costs deductible from taxable profit |
| **Vamil benefit** | 75% of investment costs can be depreciated at chosen time |
| **Minimum investment** | €2,500 per application |
| **Eligibility** | NL-registered, liable for income or corporate tax |
| **Requirement** | Investment must be on the "Milieulijst" (Environment List) or qualify under generic categories |

**Our fit: 6/10 (when making hardware investments)**

**What we meet:**
- NL-registered entity subject to corporate tax
- Investments in waste-reduction technology likely qualify under generic MIA categories
- Environmental robot for litter collection has clear environmental benefit

**What we don't meet (yet):**
- No hardware investments yet — purely digital phase
- Need to actually purchase qualifying equipment

**Strategic value:** When we do build prototypes, MIA/Vamil could reduce the effective cost by 27-45%. On a $10K prototype, that's $2.7K-$4.5K saved.

**Recommendation:** Keep on radar. Apply when making first hardware purchases. Notify RVO within 3 months of investment.

### 2.5 Innovation Impact Challenge (Dutch SBIR)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Innovation Impact Challenge (formerly SBIR) |
| **Administering body** | RVO, on behalf of Dutch government ministries |
| **Type** | Government procurement of innovative solutions |
| **Phase 1** | Feasibility research |
| **Phase 2** | Development to end product |
| **Status** | No open calls for waste/urban cleaning currently |

**Our fit: 7/10 (if relevant challenge opens)**

This is a government-procurement model — a ministry identifies a problem (e.g., "how to keep public spaces clean autonomously") and invites companies to propose solutions. If a relevant challenge opens, this is ideal for us.

**Recommendation:** Monitor RVO's Innovation Impact Challenge page for urban cleaning, waste management, or smart city challenges. Contact RVO proactively to suggest a challenge in this domain.

---

### 2.6 Other NL Opportunities

**Municipal Innovation Programs**
- Amsterdam: "Clean & Waste Free Framework 2025-2028" — potential pilot partner
- Rotterdam: Circular economy focus, goal of 100% circular public services by 2030
- These are not grants but potential customer relationships / pilot partnerships
- **Recommendation:** Approach Amsterdam and Rotterdam as pilot cities, not grant sources

---

## REGION 3: UNITED STATES

### 3.1 DOT SMART Grant

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART) Grants Program |
| **Administering body** | US Department of Transportation |
| **Funding** | Stage 1: up to $2M (18 months, planning/prototyping); Stage 2: up to $15M (36 months, implementation) |
| **Eligible applicants** | Public sector agencies only (state/local governments, transit agencies, tribal governments) |
| **Eight technology domains** | Connected vehicles, coordinated automation, commerce/delivery logistics, innovative aviation, intelligent sensor-based infrastructure, smart grids, systems integration, smart traffic signals |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Critical issues:**
1. Only public sector agencies can apply — we'd need a US city partner
2. **Stage 1 is permanently closed** — no additional Stage 1 opportunities will be released
3. Stage 2 requires prior Stage 1 award — since we have no Stage 1, Stage 2 is inaccessible

**Relevant domains:**
- "Coordinated automation" — autonomous robot operation
- "Intelligent sensor-based infrastructure" — our perception system

**What we meet:**
- Technology aligns with SMART's automation and sensor-based infrastructure domains
- Austin is already identified as a target city with progressive robotics policy

**What we don't meet:**
- Cannot apply directly — need a municipal partner
- No US presence or relationships with city government yet
- Competition is fierce from US-based companies

**Application effort:** 20-40 hours (our portion, if a city partner leads)

**Strategic value:** Very high if secured — DOT backing for a pilot in Austin would be transformative for US market entry. $2M Stage 1 would fully fund our pilot.

**Recommendation:** Begin relationship-building with Austin Resource Recovery Department. If they're interested in our technology, they could include us in a future SMART application. This is a 12-18 month play.

---

### 3.2 SBIR/STTR (Small Business Innovation Research)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer |

| **EPA Phase I** | Up to $100K (6 months, proof of concept) |
| **EPA Phase II** | Up to $400K (development + commercialization) |
| **DOE Phase I** | Up to $200K |

**STATUS: PROGRAMS EXPIRED SEPTEMBER 30, 2025**

The SBIR and STTR programs' congressional authorization lapsed on September 30, 2025. As of February 2026:
- No new solicitations or awards are being issued
- H.R.5100 (1-year clean extension) passed the House unanimously
- Reauthorization expected to be attached to broader budget legislation in early 2026
- NSF has paused all new Project Pitches
- NASA is preparing a Broad Agency Announcement format for when reauthorization passes

**Our fit: 1/10**

**Disqualifying issue:** SBIR/STTR requires the company to be **at least 51% owned by US citizens or permanent residents**. As a Dutch-founded LLC, we do not meet this fundamental requirement — regardless of reauthorization status.

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue. If we ever establish a US subsidiary with majority US ownership, reassess.

---

## REGION 4: SINGAPORE

### 4.1 RoboNexus Accelerator

**Our fit: 5/10**

**What we meet:**
- Robotics company — perfect domain match
- Strong APAC market ambitions (Singapore is our #1 APAC market)
- Willing to establish SG entity if needed

**What we don't meet:**
- Need Singapore-based entity (incorporation cost: ~S$3,500-4,000 for foreigners)
- Need local resident director (nominee: S$1,800-2,500/year)
- Program seems oriented toward companies further along than pre-revenue

**Strategic value:** Direct access to Singapore's robotics ecosystem, NEA connections, potential municipal pilots. Singapore incorporation also unlocks other SG grants.

| **Full name** | Enterprise Development Grant |
| **Administering body** | Enterprise Singapore |
| **Funding** | Up to 50% of qualifying project costs (up to 70% for SMEs) |
| **Eligibility** | At least 30% local equity (Singaporean/PR ownership) |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Disqualifying issue:** Requires 30% local equity held by Singaporeans or PRs. We would need a local co-founder or investor with significant equity stake.

**Recommendation:** Not viable unless we take on a Singaporean co-founder/investor.

---

### 4.4 RISC Grant (EDB)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Research Incentive Scheme for Companies |
| **Administering body** | Economic Development Board (EDB) |

| **Current status** | Cohort 11 currently accepting applications |
| **Eligibility** | Open to international companies with market-stage innovations |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- Open to international companies — no UAE entity required to apply
- Equity-free — no dilution
- Market access to UAE ecosystem (our Phase 1 market)
- BEEAH, Dubai Municipality, and other potential partners in their network
- "Global ambitions" is exactly our positioning

**What we don't meet:**
- "Market-stage innovation" — we're pre-market
- May prefer companies with more traction

**Application effort:** 10-20 hours

**Strategic value:** Very high. Direct pathway to BEEAH partnership, Dubai Municipality connections, and UAE market entry. The MBRIF brand carries significant weight in MENA.

**Recommendation:** **APPLY NOW for Cohort 11.** Even if we're early-stage, the equity-free, mentorship-focused format means low downside risk. Frame our application around the BEEAH/Dubai opportunity.

**URGENT: Cohort 11 is currently open — check mbrif.ae for deadline**

| **Full name** | Catalyst — A Masdar Initiative |
| **Location** | Masdar City, Abu Dhabi |
| **Type** | Cleantech startup accelerator |
| **Offering** | Seed funding + training + mentoring + workspace |
| **Focus** | Energy, water, and clean tech |
| **Eligibility** | Open to startups from UAE and beyond |

**Our fit: 6/10**

**What we meet:**

**What we don't meet:**
- Core focus is energy/water, not waste management
- Would require Abu Dhabi presence during program

**Application effort:** 10-20 hours

### 5.6 Hub71 Access Programme (Abu Dhabi)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Hub71 — Abu Dhabi's Global Tech Ecosystem |
| **Type** | Tech ecosystem with incentive packages |
| **Offering** | Subsidized housing, office space, cloud credits, healthcare |
| **Location** | Abu Dhabi |

**Our fit: 5/10**

Hub71 is more of an ecosystem than a grant — they offer incentive packages to attract tech companies to Abu Dhabi. The value is in subsidized operations cost, not direct funding.

**Recommendation:** Consider when planning physical UAE presence.

### 5.7 Dubai Robotics and Automation Program (DRAP)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Dubai Robotics and Automation Program |
| **Administering body** | Dubai Council for Robotics and Automation |
| **Goal** | 200,000 robots deployed by 2032; R&A sector = 9% of GDP |
| **Sectors** | Services, logistics, industrial |

This is a government strategy program, not a direct grant. However, it creates the **demand environment** for our product. The DRAP means Dubai is actively seeking robotics companies to help achieve their 200,000-robot target.

**Our fit:** N/A (not a grant, but a strategic signal)

**Recommendation:** Reference the DRAP in all UAE outreach. Position CleanWalker as helping Dubai achieve its R&A goals.

**UAE Entity Setup Cost (for reference):**
- Cheapest free zone license: AED 4,888 (~$1,330) — Ajman NuVenture
- Dubai free zone: AED 12,500-12,900 (~$3,400-3,500) — Meydan/IFZA
- Visa costs: AED 3,800-6,500 additional
- 100% foreign ownership permitted in free zones

## Critical Legal Note: LLC vs BV

MB Software Studio LLC is a US-type LLC. Since January 1, 2025, Dutch tax law treats a US LLC as equivalent to a Dutch BV (non-transparent entity subject to corporate income tax).

**Implications for grants:**
- **WBSO:** Likely eligible as the LLC is subject to Dutch payroll/corporate tax, but ambiguity remains
- **EIC/Horizon Europe:** Requires entity "established in" an EU Member State. An NL-based LLC should qualify, but a BV is unambiguous
- **Innovatiekrediet:** Requires NL-established company. LLC should qualify but needs verification
- **MIA/Vamil:** Requires Dutch corporate tax liability. LLC qualifies since Jan 2025

**Double taxation risk:** The LLC is transparent for US tax (pass-through to founder's personal return) but opaque for Dutch tax (corporate income tax up to 25.8%). This can create double taxation situations with limited treaty relief.

**Strong recommendation:** Convert to a Dutch BV before applying for major grants. This:
1. Removes all eligibility ambiguity
2. Eliminates double-taxation risk
3. Is expected by European investors
4. Costs ~€500-2,000 for incorporation
5. Is a standard structure for NL-based tech startups
