# Grant Opportunities — CleanWalker Robotics

Last updated: 2026-02-10

## Company Profile (for eligibility assessment)

- **Entity:** MB Software Studio LLC (US-type LLC, Dutch founder, NL-based operations)
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue, digital prototype only (ML model, simulation, CAD — no physical robot)
- **Team:** Solo founder + AI tooling
- **Needs:** ~$363K to reach pilot stage
- **Legal note:** US LLC is classified as equivalent to a Dutch BV for Dutch tax purposes since Jan 1, 2025. This makes us subject to Dutch corporate income tax but may enable access to Dutch R&D incentives. For EU grants, our NL establishment qualifies us as an EU-based SME. Converting to a Dutch BV would remove all ambiguity.

## REGION 1: EUROPEAN UNION

### 1.1 EIC Accelerator — Open Track

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | European Innovation Council Accelerator — Open |
| **Administering body** | European Innovation Council (EISMEA) |
| **Funding** | Up to €2.5M grant + up to €10M equity via EIC Fund |
| **Minimum blended finance** | €1M (increased from €500K in 2025) |
| **Total 2026 budget** | €414M |
| **Deadlines** | Bimonthly cut-offs: Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov 2026 |
| **Eligibility** | SMEs established in EU Member State or Associated Country |
| **TRL requirement** | TRL 6-8 (validated in relevant environment) for development; TRL 9 for scale-up |

**Our fit: 5/10**

**What we meet:**
- NL-based entity (LLC treated as BV equivalent for EU purposes)
- Deep-tech innovation (robotics + AI + environmental)
- Clear global scale-up ambition
- Open to any technology field — litter-collecting robots qualify

**What we don't meet:**
- TRL 6-8 requirement — we are at TRL 2-3 (concept + ML model, no physical prototype)
- "Financial maturity" valued — we are pre-revenue with no prior funding rounds
- Physical prototype expected at this stage

**Application effort:** 80-120 hours (short proposal + full proposal + interview if shortlisted)

**Strategic value:** Massive credibility boost. EIC portfolio companies get Business Acceleration Services, investor connections, and procurement introductions to EU municipalities. Would instantly validate the company.

**Recommendation:** Not ready now. Target for Q1-Q2 2027 after building a TRL 4-5 prototype.

### 1.2 EIC Advanced Innovation Challenge — Physical AI

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | EIC Advanced Innovation Challenge: Physical AI |
| **Administering body** | European Innovation Council |
| **Funding** | €300,000 (Stage 1); higher amounts for Stage 2 |
| **TRL requirement** | TRL 4 minimum (prototype tested in lab) |
| **Target TRL** | TRL 6-7 by end of Stage 2 |

**Three application domains:**
1. Disaster response and civil security physical agents
2. Autonomous labs for scientific discovery
3. **Personal or professional robot assistants** ← our best fit

**Requirements:**
- Initial prototype tested in laboratory conditions
- Access to infrastructure for data collection and testing
- A challenging use case formulated by a potential end-user, supported by a letter of intent
- Mandatory 1 person-month for workshops and demos

**Our fit: 6/10**

**What we meet:**
- "Professional robot assistant" framing fits an autonomous litter-collecting robot
- ML model and simulation work show R&D capability
- Lower TRL bar (TRL 4 vs TRL 6 for main Accelerator)
- NL-based entity qualifies

**What we don't meet:**
- Need "initial prototype tested in laboratory conditions" — we have no physical prototype
- Need a letter of intent from an end-user or robotics integrator
- Environmental/waste collection is NOT explicitly listed (domains focus on disaster response, labs, personal assistants)

**Application effort:** 40-60 hours

**Strategic value:** €300K would fund our first physical prototype. The "Physical AI" branding aligns perfectly with our positioning. Access to EIC network of robotics integrators.

**Recommendation:** High priority target once we have a basic physical prototype (even a modified off-the-shelf quadruped with our ML model). Secure a letter of intent from a municipal partner first. Target: late 2026 or early 2027.

---

### 1.3 EIC Accelerator — Climate Adaptation Challenge

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | EIC Accelerator Challenge: Deep Tech for Climate Adaptation |
| **Budget** | €50M allocated |
| **Funding** | Up to €2.5M grant + equity |

**Scope focuses on:**
1. Urban heat mitigation (materials, coatings, cooling)
2. Climate-smart agriculture (crops, pest management)
3. Water scarcity solutions (filtration, reuse)
4. Flood/coastal protection (infrastructure, early warning)

**Our fit: 2/10**

Litter-collecting robots, waste management, and urban cleaning are **NOT within scope**. This challenge is narrowly focused on climate adaptation, not urban sustainability broadly. Do not apply.

---

### 1.4 Horizon Europe (2026-2027 Work Programme)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Horizon Europe Framework Programme |
| **Administering body** | European Commission (various Executive Agencies) |
| **Relevant clusters** | CL5 (Climate, Energy, Mobility), CL6 (Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources) |
| **Funding** | Typically €1-5M per project |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Key issues:**
- **Consortium required:** Minimum 3 independent entities from 3 different EU countries. We'd need to find 2+ partners.
- **No relevant open calls:** No 2026-2027 calls specifically target autonomous litter/waste collection robots
- **Closest call found:** HORIZON-CL5-2026-02-D4-01 — "On-site innovative robotic solutions for building renovation" — not relevant
- **Circular economy calls** (CL6) exist but focus on materials/textiles, not robotic waste collection
- **Application effort:** 200-400 hours for a consortium application
- **Success rate:** ~15% — extremely competitive

**Strategic value:** High prestige but disproportionate effort for a tiny team.

**Recommendation:** Skip for now. Revisit if we join a consortium led by a university or large company (e.g., if Veolia or a robotics institute invites us).

## REGION 2: NETHERLANDS

### 2.1 WBSO (Wet Bevordering Speur- en Ontwikkelingswerk)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Act for the Promotion of Research and Development Work |
| **Administering body** | RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency) |
| **Type** | R&D tax credit (payroll tax reduction) |
| **Benefit** | **Starters: 50%** on first €380K of R&D wages; Regular: 36% on first €380K; 16% above. Self-employed: €15,979 deduction + €7,996 starter supplement |
| **Who can apply** | Companies subject to Dutch payroll tax (inhoudingsplichtige) OR self-employed persons (zelfstandigen) performing R&D |
| **Deadlines** | Three application periods per year; must apply before R&D work starts for each period |
| **Legal entity** | BV, NV, eenmanszaak, VOF all eligible. LLC treated as BV equivalent since Jan 2025 |
| **R&D must occur** | Within the EU |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- Our ML training, simulation work, hardware design, and firmware development all qualify as S&O (research and development)
- LLC is treated as BV equivalent for Dutch tax purposes
- Pre-revenue companies can benefit (it's a tax credit, not dependent on profit)
- Self-employed persons (IB-ondernemers) can also claim a fixed deduction

**What we don't meet / risks:**
- If founder has no salary from the LLC, the payroll tax reduction has no base to apply to
- Need to apply BEFORE the R&D period starts
- Must track R&D hours diligently (administration requirement)

**Application effort:** 8-16 hours per application (straightforward online form via eHerkenning)

**Strategic value:** Beyond the tax savings, WBSO approval is a recognized "quality mark" — it signals to investors and other grant bodies that your R&D is validated. Often a prerequisite for Innovatiekrediet.

**Recommendation:** **APPLY IMMEDIATELY.** This is the lowest-hanging fruit. Even if the immediate tax benefit is modest (depends on salary structure), the WBSO approval strengthens all future grant applications.

**URGENT: Next application window — check RVO.nl for 2026 Period 2 deadline (typically ~1 month before period starts)**

---

### 2.2 Innovatiekrediet (Innovation Credit)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Innovatiekrediet |
| **Administering body** | RVO |
| **Type** | Government-backed innovation loan (repayable if project succeeds) |
| **Funding** | €150K–€10M (technical projects); €150K–€5M (clinical) |
| **Interest** | 3.0% annual + 15% one-time markup |
| **Co-financing** | At least 55% from other sources required |
| **Legal entity** | No specific restriction to BV — must be NL-established company |
| **Application** | Year-round (rolling) |

**Conditions:**
1. Technically new product/process/service, new to the Netherlands
2. Substantial technical risk (not just commercial risk)
3. Company with substantial activities in NL
4. Market-ready outcome within 5 years
5. Prior proof-of-concept work demonstrating feasibility understanding
6. Clear development path
7. Complete financing plan (own capital + investors for the 55% co-financing)
8. Contingency reserves

**Our fit: 5/10**

**What we meet:**
- Highly innovative product (no commercial quadrupedal litter robot exists)
- Substantial technical risk (robotics + outdoor AI + manipulation)
- NL-based company
- Clear market opportunity documented in our research

**What we don't meet (yet):**
- Need proof-of-concept work (we only have digital/simulation work)
- Need 55% co-financing from other sources — at €363K total, we'd need ~$200K from investors
- Need documented financing discussions (term sheets, even unsigned)
- Need contingency reserves

**Application effort:** 40-80 hours (business plan, technical description, financial projections)

**Strategic value:** Favorable terms — the loan is only repayable if the project succeeds. If the prototype fails, the debt is forgiven. This is essentially risk-free funding.

**Recommendation:** Target for H2 2026, after securing some form of co-financing (even a small angel investment or letter of intent). Having WBSO approval first strengthens this application significantly.

| **Duration** | Max 12 months |
| **Eligible costs** | Employee wages, external advisory, materials, equipment rental |
| **Application** | Regional — first-come, first-served (lottery on day 1 if oversubscribed) |
| **2026 opening** | April 8, 2026 (some regions); June 9–Sep 15, 2026 (South Holland) |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- SME conducting feasibility research
- Technical innovation (autonomous litter robot)
- Study into economic and technical feasibility is exactly what we need

**What we don't meet:**
- Budget typically exhausted on day one — need to be very fast
- Small amount (€20K max) — useful but not transformative

**Application effort:** 8-16 hours

**Strategic value:** Quick validation of concept. The €20K could fund external engineering consultation or a basic hardware feasibility study. Having MIT approval on record helps with later applications.

**Recommendation:** Apply on April 8, 2026 opening day. Prepare application in advance.

**URGENT: Application window opens April 8, 2026 — within 90 days!**

---

### 2.4 MIA/Vamil (Environmental Investment Tax Deductions)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Milieu-investeringsaftrek (MIA) / Willekeurige Afschrijving Milieu-investeringen (Vamil) |
| **Administering body** | RVO |
| **MIA benefit** | 27%, 36%, or 45% of investment costs deductible from taxable profit |
| **Vamil benefit** | 75% of investment costs can be depreciated at chosen time |
| **Minimum investment** | €2,500 per application |
| **Eligibility** | NL-registered, liable for income or corporate tax |
| **Requirement** | Investment must be on the "Milieulijst" (Environment List) or qualify under generic categories |

**Our fit: 6/10 (when making hardware investments)**

**What we meet:**
- NL-registered entity subject to corporate tax
- Investments in waste-reduction technology likely qualify under generic MIA categories
- Environmental robot for litter collection has clear environmental benefit

**What we don't meet (yet):**
- No hardware investments yet — purely digital phase
- Need to actually purchase qualifying equipment

**Strategic value:** When we do build prototypes, MIA/Vamil could reduce the effective cost by 27-45%. On a $10K prototype, that's $2.7K-$4.5K saved.

**Recommendation:** Keep on radar. Apply when making first hardware purchases. Notify RVO within 3 months of investment.

---

### 2.5 Innovation Impact Challenge (Dutch SBIR)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Innovation Impact Challenge (formerly SBIR) |
| **Administering body** | RVO, on behalf of Dutch government ministries |
| **Type** | Government procurement of innovative solutions |
| **Phase 1** | Feasibility research |
| **Phase 2** | Development to end product |
| **Status** | No open calls for waste/urban cleaning currently |

**Our fit: 7/10 (if relevant challenge opens)**

This is a government-procurement model — a ministry identifies a problem (e.g., "how to keep public spaces clean autonomously") and invites companies to propose solutions. If a relevant challenge opens, this is ideal for us.

**Recommendation:** Monitor RVO's Innovation Impact Challenge page for urban cleaning, waste management, or smart city challenges. Contact RVO proactively to suggest a challenge in this domain.

---

### 2.6 VFF / Proof-of-Concept Funding

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Vroegefasefinanciering (VFF) / Proof-of-Concept Fund |
| **Administering body** | RVO |
| **Type** | Government loan for concept-to-prototype development |
| **Funding** | Up to €450,000 |
| **2026 budget** | €2.25M (national) + €4.95M (academic track) |
| **Application** | January 1 – December 31, 2026 (or until budget depleted) |
| **Requirement** | Must have a matching investor letter of intent for at least the same amount |
| **Eligibility** | SME, innovative startup (max 5 years old) |

**Our fit: 5/10 (currently) → 8/10 (with angel investor LOI)**

**What we meet:**
- Perfect stage fit — designed for developing a concept into a working prototype
- Up to €450K covers our entire pilot budget
- Innovative startup < 5 years old

**What we don't meet (yet):**
- Requires a **matching investor declaration of intent** — need an investor willing to commit at least as much as the government loan
- Very small national budget (€2.25M total across all applicants)
- LLC entity uncertainty

**Strategic value:** This could be transformative — €450K government + €450K investor = €900K, enough for multiple prototype iterations and a pilot. The government backing also de-risks the deal for the investor.

**Recommendation:** Start investor conversations now. Once you have an angel/VC LOI, apply immediately — budget is limited.

---

### 2.7 Eurostars (International R&D Collaboration)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|

**Our fit: 4/10**

**What we meet:**
- Robotics/AI is in scope
- SME-led projects (SMEs must account for 50%+ of budget)

**What we don't meet:**
- Need an international partner (another SME or research org from a different country)
- Application is complex for a solo founder
- LLC entity uncertainty for NL national co-funding

**Recommendation:** If you have contacts at a European robotics company or university, this is worth considering. The March 19 deadline is tight but feasible.

**URGENT: Deadline March 19, 2026 — within 90 days**

---

### 2.8 Regional Development Agencies (ROMs)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Type** | Equity investments (not grants) |
| **Funding** | Typically €100K–€500K |
| **Total assets** | €2.3 billion combined across all ROMs |
| **2023 investments** | €219M in 372 companies |

**Key ROMs by province:**

- These are not grants but potential customer relationships / pilot partnerships
- **Recommendation:** Approach Amsterdam and Rotterdam as pilot cities, not grant sources

---

## REGION 3: UNITED STATES

### 3.1 DOT SMART Grant

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART) Grants Program |
| **Administering body** | US Department of Transportation |
| **Funding** | Stage 1: up to $2M (18 months, planning/prototyping); Stage 2: up to $15M (36 months, implementation) |
| **Eligible applicants** | Public sector agencies only (state/local governments, transit agencies, tribal governments) |
| **Eight technology domains** | Connected vehicles, coordinated automation, commerce/delivery logistics, innovative aviation, intelligent sensor-based infrastructure, smart grids, systems integration, smart traffic signals |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Critical issues:**
1. Only public sector agencies can apply — we'd need a US city partner
2. **Stage 1 is permanently closed** — no additional Stage 1 opportunities will be released
3. Stage 2 requires prior Stage 1 award — since we have no Stage 1, Stage 2 is inaccessible

**Relevant domains:**
- "Coordinated automation" — autonomous robot operation
- "Intelligent sensor-based infrastructure" — our perception system

**What we meet:**
- Technology aligns with SMART's automation and sensor-based infrastructure domains
- Austin is already identified as a target city with progressive robotics policy

**What we don't meet:**
- Cannot apply directly — need a municipal partner
- No US presence or relationships with city government yet
- Competition is fierce from US-based companies

**Application effort:** 20-40 hours (our portion, if a city partner leads)

**Strategic value:** Very high if secured — DOT backing for a pilot in Austin would be transformative for US market entry. $2M Stage 1 would fully fund our pilot.

**Recommendation:** Begin relationship-building with Austin Resource Recovery Department. If they're interested in our technology, they could include us in a future SMART application. This is a 12-18 month play.

---

### 3.2 SBIR/STTR (Small Business Innovation Research)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer |
| **Agencies** | EPA, DOE, NSF, NASA, DoD, NIH, and others |
| **EPA Phase I** | Up to $100K (6 months, proof of concept) |
| **EPA Phase II** | Up to $400K (development + commercialization) |
| **DOE Phase I** | Up to $200K |

**STATUS: PROGRAMS EXPIRED SEPTEMBER 30, 2025**

The SBIR and STTR programs' congressional authorization lapsed on September 30, 2025. As of February 2026:
- No new solicitations or awards are being issued
- H.R.5100 (1-year clean extension) passed the House unanimously
- Reauthorization expected to be attached to broader budget legislation in early 2026
- NSF has paused all new Project Pitches
- NASA is preparing a Broad Agency Announcement format for when reauthorization passes

**Our fit: 1/10**

**Disqualifying issue:** SBIR/STTR requires the company to be **at least 51% owned by US citizens or permanent residents**. As a Dutch-founded LLC, we do not meet this fundamental requirement — regardless of reauthorization status.

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue. If we ever establish a US subsidiary with majority US ownership, reassess.

---

## REGION 4: SINGAPORE

### 4.1 RoboNexus Accelerator

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | RoboNexus — National Robotics Programme Accelerator |
| **Administering body** | National Robotics Programme (NRP), A*STAR |
| **Type** | 18-month accelerator (mentorship, business development, market access) |
| **Eligibility** | Singapore-based robotics companies or those establishing SG operations |
| **Funding** | Non-cash (mentorship, connections, market access) |

**Our fit: 5/10**

**What we meet:**
- Robotics company — perfect domain match
- Strong APAC market ambitions (Singapore is our #1 APAC market)
- Willing to establish SG entity if needed

**What we don't meet:**
- Need Singapore-based entity (incorporation cost: ~S$3,500-4,000 for foreigners)
- Need local resident director (nominee: S$1,800-2,500/year)
- Program seems oriented toward companies further along than pre-revenue

**Strategic value:** Direct access to Singapore's robotics ecosystem, NEA connections, potential municipal pilots. Singapore incorporation also unlocks other SG grants.

**Recommendation:** Target for Phase 2 market entry (2028-2029). Register SG entity when ready to enter the market.

---

### 4.2 Startup SG Tech

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Startup SG Tech |
| **Administering body** | Enterprise Singapore |
| **Funding** | Up to SGD 500,000 (~$370K) |
| **Eligibility** | Singapore-registered company |
| **Requirement** | Proof-of-concept or proof-of-value stage |

**Our fit: 4/10 (currently) → 7/10 (with SG entity)**

**What we meet:**
- Technology innovation in a priority domain (robotics/AI)
- Proof-of-concept stage is where we'll be

**What we don't meet:**
- Need Singapore-registered company
- May have local equity requirements (unclear for this specific program)

**Application effort:** 20-40 hours + entity registration

**Strategic value:** SGD 500K would nearly fund our entire pilot. Combined with SG's zero-tariff environment and NEA grant ecosystem, this is potentially the best funding environment globally.

**Recommendation:** Consider establishing SG entity in 2027 to access this and other SG grants. The total incorporation + compliance cost (~S$4K/year) is modest compared to potential SGD 500K grant.

---

### 4.3 Enterprise Development Grant (EDG)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Enterprise Development Grant |
| **Administering body** | Enterprise Singapore |
| **Funding** | Up to 50% of qualifying project costs (up to 70% for SMEs) |
| **Eligibility** | At least 30% local equity (Singaporean/PR ownership) |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**Disqualifying issue:** Requires 30% local equity held by Singaporeans or PRs. We would need a local co-founder or investor with significant equity stake.

**Recommendation:** Not viable unless we take on a Singaporean co-founder/investor.

---

### 4.4 RISC Grant (EDB)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Research Incentive Scheme for Companies |
| **Administering body** | Economic Development Board (EDB) |
| **Funding** | 60% of local manpower, 30% of foreign manpower and equipment |

| **Total fund** | S$10.8M |
| **Focus** | Robotic solutions for environmental services |
| **Status** | **CLOSED** — no announced 2026 reopening |
| **Eligibility** | Singapore-based entities or partnerships with local institutions |

**Our fit: 8/10 (thematic) / 0/10 (currently closed)**

This is the single best thematic match in all of Asia-Pacific — a government program specifically for environmental robotics. It covers productivity gains, sustainable workforce, and new capabilities for environmental services. If it reopens, it should be a top priority.

**Recommendation:** Monitor NEA announcements closely. If a new call opens, it justifies fast-tracking a Singapore entity setup.

---

## REGION 5: UAE / GULF

### 5.1 Dubai Future Accelerators (DFA)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Dubai Future Accelerators |
| **Administering body** | Dubai Future Foundation |
| **Type** | 9-week intensive program pairing tech companies with Dubai government orgs |
| **Funding** | No equity taken; value is direct government partnership |
| **Focus** | AI, robotics, genomics, 3D printing, biomimicry |
| **Eligibility** | Open to international companies |
| **Previous themes** | "75% reduction in Dubai's general waste" appeared in past cohorts |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- Open to international companies — no UAE entity required
- Robotics and waste management themes have appeared in past cohorts
- Direct pairing with Dubai Municipality and government organizations
- No equity taken

**What we don't meet:**
- Must be present in Dubai during the 9-week program

### 5.4 MBRIF Innovation Accelerator

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Mohammed Bin Rashid Innovation Fund — Innovation Accelerator |
| **Administering body** | MBRIF (UAE Ministry of Finance initiative) |
| **Type** | 6-month accelerator program |
| **Funding** | Equity-free (mentorship, market access, investor connections) |
| **Current status** | Cohort 11 currently accepting applications |
| **Eligibility** | Open to international companies with market-stage innovations |

**Our fit: 7/10**

**What we meet:**
- Open to international companies — no UAE entity required to apply
- Equity-free — no dilution
- Market access to UAE ecosystem (our Phase 1 market)
- BEEAH, Dubai Municipality, and other potential partners in their network
- "Global ambitions" is exactly our positioning

**What we don't meet:**
- "Market-stage innovation" — we're pre-market
- May prefer companies with more traction

**Application effort:** 10-20 hours

**Strategic value:** Very high. Direct pathway to BEEAH partnership, Dubai Municipality connections, and UAE market entry. The MBRIF brand carries significant weight in MENA.

**Recommendation:** **APPLY NOW for Cohort 11.** Even if we're early-stage, the equity-free, mentorship-focused format means low downside risk. Frame our application around the BEEAH/Dubai opportunity.

**URGENT: Cohort 11 is currently open — check mbrif.ae for deadline**

---

### 5.5 Catalyst Accelerator (Masdar City)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Catalyst — A Masdar Initiative |
| **Location** | Masdar City, Abu Dhabi |
| **Type** | Cleantech startup accelerator |
| **Offering** | Seed funding + training + mentoring + workspace |
| **Focus** | Energy, water, and clean tech |
| **Eligibility** | Open to startups from UAE and beyond |

**Our fit: 6/10**

**What we meet:**
- Cleantech/environmental innovation
- Open to international startups
- Abu Dhabi is a target market (autonomous sweepers already deployed)

**What we don't meet:**
- Core focus is energy/water, not waste management
- Would require Abu Dhabi presence during program

**Application effort:** 10-20 hours

**Strategic value:** Masdar City is a global cleantech brand. Having them as an accelerator on our CV opens doors across MENA and globally.

**Recommendation:** Monitor catalyst.ae for next cohort opening. Apply alongside MBRIF for UAE coverage.

---

### 5.6 Hub71 Access Programme (Abu Dhabi)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Hub71 — Abu Dhabi's Global Tech Ecosystem |
| **Type** | Tech ecosystem with incentive packages |
| **Offering** | Subsidized housing, office space, cloud credits, healthcare |
| **Location** | Abu Dhabi |

**Our fit: 5/10**

Hub71 is more of an ecosystem than a grant — they offer incentive packages to attract tech companies to Abu Dhabi. The value is in subsidized operations cost, not direct funding.

**Recommendation:** Consider when planning physical UAE presence.

---

### 5.7 Dubai Robotics and Automation Program (DRAP)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Dubai Robotics and Automation Program |
| **Administering body** | Dubai Council for Robotics and Automation |
| **Goal** | 200,000 robots deployed by 2032; R&A sector = 9% of GDP |
| **Sectors** | Services, logistics, industrial |

This is a government strategy program, not a direct grant. However, it creates the **demand environment** for our product. The DRAP means Dubai is actively seeking robotics companies to help achieve their 200,000-robot target.

**Our fit:** N/A (not a grant, but a strategic signal)

**Recommendation:** Reference the DRAP in all UAE outreach. Position CleanWalker as helping Dubai achieve its R&A goals.

**UAE Entity Setup Cost (for reference):**
- Cheapest free zone license: AED 4,888 (~$1,330) — Ajman NuVenture
- Dubai free zone: AED 12,500-12,900 (~$3,400-3,500) — Meydan/IFZA
- Visa costs: AED 3,800-6,500 additional
- 100% foreign ownership permitted in free zones

## REGION 6: INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS & MULTILATERAL FUNDS

*Research completed 2026-02-10. This section covers USAID, World Bank/IFC, GEF, IDB, and ADB programs.*

### Critical Context: USAID Status (February 2026)

**USAID has been effectively dismantled.** The Trump administration issued a stop-work order on January 24, 2025, followed by cancellation of 80% of foreign aid projects, layoffs of 4,200+ staff, and firing of 1,600+. The 2026 budget proposal requests an ~85% cut to US foreign aid. USAID programs referenced below are either frozen, cancelled, or transferred to the State Department.

**Implication for CleanWalker:** Do not invest time pursuing USAID-administered programs. The one exception is the independently-launched DIV Fund (see below).

---

### 6.1 USAID Clean Cities, Blue Ocean (CCBO)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | USAID Clean Cities, Blue Ocean |
| **Administering body** | USAID (implemented by Tetra Tech) |
| **Type** | Global flagship program for combating ocean plastics |
| **Grant range** | $50,000–$250,000 per sub-grant |
| **Focus** | Solid waste management, recycling, ocean plastic reduction |
| **Countries** | Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Dominican Republic, and others |
| **Eligible applicants** | NGOs, CSOs, CBOs, private foundations, universities, research institutions, business associations, private companies (profit/fees may not be charged to a grant) |
| **Private sector** | 74+ private sector partners; facilitates private capital investment in recycling value chains |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**What works:**
- Private companies can receive sub-grants ($50K–$250K)
- Technology innovation for waste management is in scope
- Supports "locally appropriate recycled/upcycled plastic products or technologies"

**What doesn't work:**
- **STATUS: EFFECTIVELY FROZEN** — USAID dismantling means no new awards expected
- Focus is on ocean plastics in specific developing countries, not autonomous litter collection generally
- Sub-grant amounts ($50K–$250K) are modest
- Profit/fees cannot be charged to grants — limits commercial viability
- Program is implemented through Tetra Tech, not direct USAID grants to companies

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue. Program is frozen/cancelled due to USAID shutdown. Even if restored, thematic fit is marginal — the program targets ocean plastics in developing countries, not autonomous cleaning technology.

---

### 6.2 USAID Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) → DIV Fund

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Development Innovation Ventures (formerly USAID; now independent nonprofit) |
| **Administering body** | DIV Fund (independent nonprofit, launched February 2026) |
| **Former USAID program** | Stage 1: up to $200K (proof of concept); Stage 2: up to $1.5M (testing/scaling); Stage 3: up to $15M (scaling) |
| **Leadership** | Jeff Brown (cofounder/CIO) and Sasha Gallant (former USAID DIV head, now CEO) |
| **Status** | Newly launched — funding model and application process TBD |

**Our fit: 3/10 (speculative)**

**What works:**
- The original DIV was known as USAID's "discovery engine" — funded innovative solutions to development challenges
- Stage 1 ($200K) was designed for proof-of-concept with rigorous evidence requirements
- Technology innovation was explicitly in scope

**What doesn't work:**
- **Brand new organization** — no track record, unclear funding sources, unknown application timeline
- USAID's $32B foreign aid budget (down from $68B) is not available to this independent entity
- Eligibility criteria for private companies not yet established
- Focus remains on development outcomes in low/middle-income countries

**Recommendation:** Monitor the DIV Fund (divfund.org or similar) for launch announcements. If they establish a clean application process with Stage 1 grants for private companies, worth exploring. Do not invest time until the organization is operational.

### 6.3 World Bank / IFC — Direct Private Sector Investment

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | International Finance Corporation (IFC) — Private Sector Arm of World Bank Group |
| **Type** | Equity investments, loans, and advisory services to private companies in developing countries |
| **Waste management commitment** | $1.5B+ in waste management projects globally |
| **Circular economy commitment** | $1B+ in circular economy projects in emerging markets |
| **Venture capital** | $2.7B+ committed across 165 tech companies and 122 VC funds |
| **Startup Catalyst** | Invests $4M–$6M into early-stage seed fund managers in emerging markets |
| **Geographic focus** | Emerging markets only (not EU or US) |

**Our fit: 3/10**

**What works:**
- IFC actively invests in waste management and circular economy companies
- Venture Capital Group focuses on disruptive technology in emerging markets
- Startup Catalyst seeds local early-stage funds (which could then invest in us)
- Climate tech is a stated priority

**What doesn't work:**
- **IFC does not fund early-stage startups directly** — they invest in later-stage companies or fund managers
- Minimum deal sizes are typically $1M+ for direct investments (we need $363K)
- Primary focus is companies already operating in emerging markets, not pre-revenue EU/US startups
- IFC invests in companies deploying in developing countries — we're targeting Netherlands, UAE, Singapore first
- Application is not a "grant application" — it's an investment pitch to IFC's sector teams

**Recommendation:** Not relevant at current stage. Revisit when deploying in developing countries (e.g., Colombia, India) with revenue and proven technology. IFC could be relevant for Series A/B financing for emerging market expansion.

---

### 6.4 World Bank — City Climate Finance Gap Fund

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | City Climate Finance Gap Fund |
| **Administering body** | World Bank and European Investment Bank |
| **Type** | Early-stage technical assistance for cities |
| **Eligible applicants** | Cities/local governments OR private sector providers submitting on behalf of a city |
| **Eligible sectors** | Solid waste management, circular economy, energy efficiency, water management, green infrastructure |
| **Eligible countries** | All countries on OECD DAC list of ODA recipients |
| **Application** | Rolling (no deadlines) |
| **Private sector path** | "Applications may be made by private sector providers of urban services" and "public or private developers with clear linkages to sub-national governments" |

**Our fit: 4/10**

**What works:**
- Solid waste management and circular economy are explicitly eligible sectors
- Private sector providers of urban services can apply
- Rolling applications with no deadlines
- No development stage requirements mentioned

**What doesn't work:**
- Requires a city/local government partnership — we need a municipal partner in a developing country
- Provides technical assistance, not equipment/product funding — they help cities plan, not buy robots
- Netherlands is NOT on the OECD DAC list (it's a donor country, not recipient)
- Would need to partner with a city in Colombia, India, or another developing country
- Primarily funds feasibility studies and project preparation, not technology procurement

**Recommendation:** Potentially useful if/when piloting in Colombia. Would need to partner with a Colombian city (Bogota, Medellin) that wants to explore autonomous cleaning technology. The city would be the applicant; we would be the technology partner. Very early to pursue this.

---

### 6.5 World Bank — PROBLUE (Blue Economy Program)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | PROBLUE — Global Program for the Blue Economy |
| **Administering body** | World Bank (multi-donor trust fund) |
| **Focus** | Ocean health: fisheries, ocean pollution, circular economy for plastics |
| **Waste commitment** | $50M committed to 100+ activities |
| **Pillar 2** | "Marine Pollution" — includes solid waste management to prevent ocean leakage |
| **Private sector** | Indirectly — funds government capacity to mobilize private sector finance |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**What works:**
- Solid waste management is in scope (preventing ocean-bound waste)
- Circular economy transition is a stated goal

**What doesn't work:**
- **Does not fund private companies directly** — funds World Bank project teams and government programs
- Focus is specifically on marine/ocean pollution, not urban litter generally
- Private sector is engaged indirectly through capacity building, not grants
- No application process for companies — PROBLUE supports World Bank operations internally

**Recommendation:** Not applicable. PROBLUE is an internal World Bank funding mechanism, not a grant program for companies.

---

### 6.6 World Bank — Global Partnership for Results-Based Approaches (GPRBA)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Global Partnership for Results-Based Approaches |
| **Administering body** | World Bank Group |
| **Type** | Results-based grants to World Bank projects |
| **Grant range** | $3M–$6M per project |
| **Sectors** | Education, energy, health, solid waste management, water & sanitation |
| **Reach** | 58 projects in 33 countries, 13M+ beneficiaries |

**Our fit: 1/10**

**What works:**
- Solid waste management is a listed sector

**What doesn't work:**
- **Not a grant program for companies** — provides results-based financing to World Bank-administered projects
- Grants go to government programs, not private companies
- Companies can only participate as contractors/suppliers within funded projects
- Application is through World Bank project preparation, not direct company application

**Recommendation:** Not applicable for direct funding. However, if a World Bank waste management project in Colombia or elsewhere seeks autonomous cleaning technology, we could be a technology supplier within that project. This is a very indirect path.

---

### 6.7 GEF — Global Environment Facility (GEF-8 Cycle)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Global Environment Facility — 8th Replenishment (GEF-8) |
| **Budget** | $5.3B for grants and blended finance (through June 2026) |
| **Next cycle** | GEF-9: July 2026 – June 2030 |
| **Focus areas** | Biodiversity, climate change, chemicals & waste, international waters, land degradation |
| **Waste programs** | $700M approved for chemicals/waste management, water resilience, biodiversity |
| **Plastics program** | $107M — Circular Solutions to Plastic Pollution (15 countries) |
| **Implementing agencies** | World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, UNIDO, regional development banks |

**Our fit: 1/10 (direct) / 4/10 (as technology partner within GEF project)**

**What works:**
- Chemicals and waste management is a major GEF focus area
- Circular economy is a stated priority
- Private sector engagement is increasingly emphasized
- $107M plastics program covers 15 countries with circular economy solutions

**What doesn't work:**
- **GEF does NOT fund private companies directly** — funds flow through implementing agencies (UNDP, World Bank, UNEP) to governments
- Companies can only participate as contractors/suppliers within GEF-funded projects
- No direct application process for companies — countries request GEF funding through their GEF Focal Points
- Focus is on policy reform and behavior change, not technology procurement
- Litter-collecting robots are not a GEF priority technology

**Recommendation:** Not applicable for direct funding. GEF funds countries, not companies. However, if a GEF-funded waste management project in a target country needs autonomous cleaning technology, we could be a supplier. This requires networking with GEF implementing agencies (UNIDO, UNDP) and positioning as a technology solution provider.

---

### 6.8 GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | GEF Small Grants Programme |
| **Administering body** | UNDP (on behalf of GEF) |
| **Grant range** | Up to $50,000 per project (up to $150K in exceptional cases) |
| **Target** | Civil society organizations (CSOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) |
| **Focus** | Indigenous peoples, women, youth; community-based environmental initiatives |
| **Waste focus** | "Local to global coalitions for chemicals and waste management" |

**Our fit: 0/10**

**Disqualifying:** Private sector technology companies are not eligible. SGP exclusively funds civil society and community-based organizations. A US LLC cannot apply.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable.

---

### 6.9 UNIDO Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | UNIDO Global Cleantech Innovation Programme |
| **Administering body** | UNIDO (funded by GEF) |
| **Type** | Cleantech accelerator program for startups and MSMEs |
| **Countries** | 15+ countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, Vietnam |
| **Target** | Early-stage cleantech startups and MSMEs |
| **Services** | Structured acceleration, mentorship, investor connections, market entry support |
| **Goal** | Support 1,250+ SMEs; 35-40% women-led |
| **Status** | Applications for 2025 cycle were open; 2026 cycle status TBD |

**Our fit: 3/10**

**What works:**
- Explicitly targets cleantech startups and MSMEs
- Acceleration support (mentorship, investor access) aligns with our needs
- Uruguay is a participant country — connection to Latin America
- Turkey is a participant — connection to MENA market

**What doesn't work:**
- **Must operate in a GCIP partner country** — Netherlands, US, UAE, Singapore, Colombia are NOT on the list
- The program is designed for startups in developing/emerging economies
- A US LLC with operations in Netherlands does not fit the geographic criteria
- We would need to establish operations in a partner country (e.g., Turkey, Morocco, or Uruguay)
- Colombia is NOT a GCIP partner country

**Recommendation:** Not applicable at current stage. If we establish operations in Turkey or Morocco as part of MENA market entry, revisit. Otherwise, skip.

---

### 6.10 Inter-American Development Bank — IDB Lab

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | IDB Lab (Innovation Laboratory of the IDB Group) |
| **Type** | Innovation/venture arm — grants, equity, and loans for innovative solutions in LAC |
| **Grant range** | $300K–$750K (non-reimbursable, requires 50% counterpart) |
| **Loan range** | $500K–$2M (reimbursable) |
| **Equity** | Venture debt for high-impact tech startups |
| **Geographic scope** | 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (includes Colombia) |
| **Impact requirement** | Solution must benefit vulnerable populations in LAC |
| **Revenue requirement** | Revenue >$1M and EBITDA positive (for equity/debt products) |
| **Waste management** | Invested $1M in Sugo Company (Peru waste-tech startup); BlueTech for Waste challenge |

**Our fit: 4/10 (current) / 6/10 (with Colombia operations)**

**What works:**
- Colombia is a target country — founder is in Colombia
- Waste management innovation is explicitly funded (Sugo investment is a precedent)
- Grants of $300K–$750K would cover our pilot needs
- US LLC can likely apply if the project impacts a LAC country
- IDB Lab has demonstrated appetite for waste-tech startups

**What doesn't work:**
- **Revenue requirement** — for equity/debt products, need >$1M revenue and profitability (we are pre-revenue)
- Grants require 50% counterpart funding (half in cash, half in kind) — at $300K grant, need $150K+ match
- Must demonstrate impact on vulnerable populations in LAC
- Autonomous litter robots are more urban/municipal than poverty-focused
- Application is competitive and complex
- Our NL/UAE/SG first-market strategy doesn't align with LAC-first requirements

**Strategic note:** The BlueTech for Waste Challenge was specifically for Caribbean countries (not Colombia). However, IDB Lab's broader portfolio includes Colombia. The Sugo Company investment ($1M in a Peruvian waste-tech startup) shows they fund this space.

**Application path:** Contact IDB Lab's Colombia country office. Frame the pitch as "autonomous cleaning technology for Colombian cities to improve urban sanitation for underserved communities." Would need to demonstrate how the technology benefits low-income urban areas in Colombia.

**Recommendation:** Worth exploring in 12-18 months when we have a prototype and can credibly plan a Colombia pilot. The grant product ($300K–$750K) is attractive but requires matching funds. Start relationship-building with IDB Lab's Colombia team now. Not actionable for immediate funding.

---

### 6.11 IDB Invest — Private Sector Arm

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | IDB Invest (private sector arm of IDB Group) |
| **Type** | Loans, equity, guarantees for private companies in LAC |
| **Waste management** | Funds circular economy and waste management companies |
| **Example** | First sustainability-linked loan for waste sector to Orizon VR (Brazil) |
| **Minimum deal size** | Typically $5M+ |
| **Target** | Established companies with revenue and profitability |

**Our fit: 1/10**

**Disqualifying:** IDB Invest targets established companies with significant revenue. Minimum deal sizes ($5M+) far exceed our needs. We are pre-revenue with no operations in LAC.

**Recommendation:** Not relevant until we are a revenue-generating company with LAC operations seeking growth capital.

---

### 6.12 Asian Development Bank — Waste Management Programs

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Asian Development Bank — Urban Development and Waste Management |
| **Type** | Sovereign loans to member governments; technical assistance grants |
| **Waste management** | Major portfolio — $200M loan to India for solid waste management in 100 cities |
| **Smart cities** | Future Cities Program promoting smart infrastructure |
| **Geographic focus** | Asia-Pacific developing member countries |

**Our fit: 1/10**

**What works:**
- Waste management and smart city technology are ADB priorities
- ADB promotes digital solutions and new technologies in waste management

**What doesn't work:**
- **ADB does NOT fund private companies directly** through its waste management programs — these are sovereign loans to governments
- Technical assistance goes to government agencies, not private companies
- We are not based in an ADB developing member country
- No application process for technology companies — ADB procurement follows government-led processes

**Recommendation:** Not applicable for direct funding. If ADB-funded waste management projects in India, Vietnam, or Indonesia seek autonomous cleaning technology vendors, we could participate as a procurement supplier. This is a long-term, indirect opportunity.

---

### 6.13 ADB — ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Trust Fund (AASCTF)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | ASEAN Australia Smart Cities Trust Fund |
| **Administering body** | ADB (funded by Government of Australia) |
| **Budget** | AUD 20M (~$13M) over 5 years |
| **Focus** | Digital urban solutions in ASEAN member states |
| **Countries** | ASEAN members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam |

**Our fit: 2/10**

**What works:**
- Smart city technology for urban service delivery is explicitly in scope
- ASEAN includes Singapore (our APAC target market)

**What doesn't work:**
- Funds are administered through ADB to government agencies, not directly to companies
- Private companies participate as technology vendors/contractors within funded projects
- Fund is relatively small (AUD 20M total across all ASEAN countries)
- No direct application path for technology companies

**Recommendation:** Not applicable for direct funding. If an ASEAN city's smart city project (funded through AASCTF) seeks autonomous cleaning technology, we could bid as a vendor. Very indirect.

---

### 6.14 ADB — Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) |
| **Administering body** | ADB |
| **Budget** | $150M multi-donor trust fund (2013-2021, now succeeded by Urban Resilience Trust Fund) |
| **Focus** | Climate-resilient urban infrastructure in Asia |
| **Waste management** | Included as part of climate-resilient solid waste infrastructure |

**Our fit: 1/10**

**Disqualifying:** Same structural issue as other ADB programs — funds flow to governments, not companies. The original UCCRTF period (2013-2021) has ended; successor fund (URTF) continues but with same government-to-government model.

**Recommendation:** Not applicable.

| USAID CCBO | 2/10 | $50K–$250K | In theory, yes | **No** — program frozen/cancelled |
| DIV Fund | 3/10 | TBD | TBD | **Monitor** — just launched Feb 2026 |
| IFC Direct | 3/10 | $1M+ | Yes (in theory) | **No** — too early stage |
| City Climate Gap Fund | 4/10 | TA only | Via city partner | **Not yet** — need municipal partner in developing country |
| PROBLUE | 2/10 | N/A | No (internal WB) | **No** — not a grant program |
| GPRBA | 1/10 | $3M–$6M | No (WB projects) | **No** — not a grant program for companies |
| GEF (direct) | 1/10 | N/A | No (funds governments) | **No** |
| GEF SGP | 0/10 | $50K | No (CSOs only) | **No** |
| GCIP (UNIDO) | 3/10 | Accelerator | No (wrong countries) | **No** — Colombia not in GCIP |
| IDB Lab | 4→6/10 | $300K–$2M | Likely yes (with LAC impact) | **12-18 months** — most promising in this category |
| IDB Invest | 1/10 | $5M+ | Yes | **No** — too early |
| ADB Waste | 1/10 | N/A | No (sovereign loans) | **No** |
| AASCTF | 2/10 | N/A | No (gov-to-gov) | **No** |
| ADB UCCRTF | 1/10 | N/A | No (gov-to-gov) | **No** |

### Key Takeaway for International Development Banks

**Almost none of these are directly actionable for CleanWalker at this stage.** The fundamental structural issue is:

1. **Multilateral development banks (World Bank, ADB) fund governments, not companies.** Their waste management programs are sovereign loans and technical assistance to national/municipal governments. Private companies participate only as contractors/suppliers within those projects.

2. **USAID is effectively shut down** as of early 2025. Its programs are frozen or cancelled.

3. **GEF funds flow through implementing agencies to governments.** No direct company application path.

4. **The one exception is IDB Lab** — the IDB Group's innovation/venture arm can fund private companies directly, requires LAC impact, and has demonstrated appetite for waste-tech startups. This is worth pursuing in 12-18 months with a Colombia pilot plan.

5. **IFC could be relevant at Series A/B stage** for emerging market expansion, but not at pre-revenue.

**Best use of these organizations at our stage:**
- **Network and position** — attend World Bank/IDB waste management events, join working groups
- **IDB Lab Colombia** — start building relationships now for a future application
- **City Climate Gap Fund** — could work if we partner with a Colombian city
- **Technology supplier** — when World Bank/ADB/GEF-funded projects seek waste management technology, position CleanWalker as a vendor option

## Critical Legal Note: LLC vs BV

MB Software Studio LLC is a US-type LLC. Since January 1, 2025, Dutch tax law treats a US LLC as equivalent to a Dutch BV (non-transparent entity subject to corporate income tax).

**Implications for grants:**
- **WBSO:** Likely eligible as the LLC is subject to Dutch payroll/corporate tax, but ambiguity remains
- **EIC/Horizon Europe:** Requires entity "established in" an EU Member State. An NL-based LLC should qualify, but a BV is unambiguous
- **Innovatiekrediet:** Requires NL-established company. LLC should qualify but needs verification
- **MIA/Vamil:** Requires Dutch corporate tax liability. LLC qualifies since Jan 2025

**Double taxation risk:** The LLC is transparent for US tax (pass-through to founder's personal return) but opaque for Dutch tax (corporate income tax up to 25.8%). This can create double taxation situations with limited treaty relief.

**Strong recommendation:** Convert to a Dutch BV before applying for major grants. This:
1. Removes all eligibility ambiguity
2. Eliminates double-taxation risk
3. Is expected by European investors
4. Costs ~€500-2,000 for incorporation
5. Is a standard structure for NL-based tech startups
