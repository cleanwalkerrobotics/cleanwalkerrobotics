### 1A — Veolia ANZ (Positive Reply)

**Subject:** RE: [their reply subject line]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for getting back to me — really appreciated.

I've attached our one-pager with the full technical overview and pilot framework (see `docs/sales/one-pager-cleanwalker.pdf`). One data point that may interest you: autonomous litter collection reduces manual cleanup labour costs by up to 40% in comparable municipal pilots globally, based on early autonomous sweeper deployments in Helsinki and Singapore.

I'd love to set up a call to discuss a Bondi-area pilot. Would any of these work?

- [Tuesday, DATE] at [TIME] AEDT
- [Wednesday, DATE] at [TIME] AEDT
- [Thursday, DATE] at [TIME] AEDT

You can also see our pilot partner program details here: https://cleanwalkerrobotics.com/pilot

Looking forward to it.

Best regards,
Maurits Bos

### 1B — BEEAH Group (Positive Reply)

**Subject:** RE: [their reply subject line]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your interest — exciting to connect with the BEEAH team.

I've attached our one-pager covering technical specs and the pilot program (see `docs/sales/one-pager-cleanwalker.pdf`). A relevant data point: the UAE generates approximately 6.5 kg of waste per capita daily — among the highest globally — and smart city infrastructure like CleanWalker can directly address the outdoor litter portion at scale.

Would any of these times work for a call?

- [Sunday, DATE] at [TIME] GST
- [Monday, DATE] at [TIME] GST
- [Tuesday, DATE] at [TIME] GST

Pilot partner details here: https://cleanwalkerrobotics.com/pilot

Looking forward to discussing a Sharjah deployment.

Best regards,
Maurits Bos

### 1C — Municipality of Amsterdam (Positive Reply)

**Subject:** RE: [their reply subject line]

Beste [Name],

Dank voor uw reactie — heel fijn om van u te horen.

I've attached our one-pager with full technical details and pilot framework (see `docs/sales/one-pager-cleanwalker.pdf`). One additional data point: Amsterdam spends an estimated EUR 150+ million annually on public space maintenance, and the Schoon & Afvalvrij Framework targets a measurable reduction in street litter by 2028. Our robots can cover 15 hectares per unit per day — Vondelpark alone would need just three units.

Would any of these times work for an introductory call?

- [Dinsdag, DATE] om [TIME] CET
- [Woensdag, DATE] om [TIME] CET
- [Donderdag, DATE] om [TIME] CET

## SET 2: Day 4 Follow-Up (No Response)

*Use when no reply after 4 days. Adds new value — not just a reminder.*

### 2A — Veolia ANZ (Day 4 Bump)

**Subject:** RE: Your Bondi Beach robot dog trial -- we built the commercial version

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up. I noticed Veolia ANZ recently expanded its resource recovery operations across New South Wales — congratulations on the growth. CleanWalker integrates directly with existing collection infrastructure, so it would slot into your current route network without new capex.

We've also just launched a live litter-detection demo you can try in your browser — it runs our actual YOLO model on your webcam feed: https://cleanwalkerrobotics.com/demos/litter-detection

Worth 60 seconds of your time if you're curious about the detection accuracy.

Happy to chat whenever suits.

### 2B — BEEAH Group (Day 4 Bump)

**Subject:** RE: Autonomous quadruped litter robot for Sharjah

Hi [Name],

Following up briefly. I saw BEEAH recently inaugurated the new Sharjah Waste-to-Energy plant — impressive milestone in closing the waste loop. CleanWalker addresses the upstream side of that equation: intercepting litter before it enters waterways and landfills.

We've built a browser-based demo of our AI litter detection — runs our real YOLO model live on your camera: https://cleanwalkerrobotics.com/demos/litter-detection

60 seconds to see the detection quality for yourself.

Happy to connect at your convenience.

### 2C — Municipality of Amsterdam (Day 4 Bump)

**Subject:** RE: Autonome afvalrobot voor Amsterdam

Beste [Name],

Kort vervolg. I noticed the gemeente recently published updated cleanliness metrics for Amsterdam's parks showing continued pressure on manual maintenance budgets. CleanWalker is designed to augment — not replace — your existing teams, operating during off-hours when parks are quiet.

We have a live browser demo of our AI litter detection — it runs our actual model on your webcam: https://cleanwalkerrobotics.com/demos/litter-detection

Takes 60 seconds and works on any laptop.

Graag hoor ik van u.

## SET 3: Day 10 Value-Add (Generic — Still No Response)

*Use for any Tier 1 target that hasn't responded by Day 10. Not per-target — positions CleanWalker as a thought leader by sharing an industry insight.*

**Subject:** Thought you'd find this relevant — autonomous cleaning market hitting inflection point

Hi [Name],

Came across this and thought of our earlier email: the autonomous outdoor cleaning market is projected to reach USD 2.1 billion by 2030 (Allied Market Research, 2025), with municipal and facilities management as the two fastest-growing segments.

What's driving it isn't the technology — it's the labour shortage. Cleaning and waste collection roles have a 35%+ annual turnover rate across OECD countries. Autonomy is becoming a staffing strategy, not just an innovation story.

We're publishing our own data on this soon. Happy to share a preview if useful.
