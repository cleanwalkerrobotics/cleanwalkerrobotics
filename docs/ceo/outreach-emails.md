## Email 1: Veolia ANZ — Bondi Beach Quadruped Trial

**To:** Veolia Australia/New Zealand — Innovation or Environmental Services lead (research exact contact on LinkedIn; look for the team behind the Bondi Beach "Scoop Doggy Dog" robot trial)

**Subject:** Your Bondi Beach robot dog trial -- we built the commercial version

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. I'm reaching out because of your quadruped litter-collection trial at Bondi Beach -- the "Scoop Doggy Dog" project. That trial proved the concept works. We're building the commercial product.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, all-terrain locomotion (grass, sand, cobblestones, stairs), and a bag cassette system that integrates with existing waste collection routes. No new infrastructure needed.

We've completed our perception pipeline (YOLO-trained on 25,000+ litter images), full hardware architecture, and detailed cost modelling. We're now seeking a pilot partner to deploy 10 units at a real site.

Veolia is the obvious partner -- you've already tested this exact technology category, and you operate in 56 countries. A successful pilot together could scale globally across your contract portfolio.

**Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss a pilot program?** Happy to share our technical specs and a site-specific proposal.

## Email 2: BEEAH Group — Smart City Autonomous Cleaning

**To:** BEEAH Digital or BEEAH Tandeef leadership (research on LinkedIn; BEEAH Digital handles future tech, Tandeef handles city cleaning operations)

**Subject:** Autonomous quadruped litter robot for Sharjah -- aligns with your smart city vision

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. BEEAH's work in autonomous city cleaning and smart waste management -- from your AI City Vision system to your AI-driven headquarters -- is exactly the environment our robot is built for.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. It uses AI vision to detect litter, walks any terrain (parks, plazas, sand, stairs), picks up items from cigarette butts to bottles, and bags waste for existing collection routes. Fully autonomous, 20+ hours per day.

No other commercial product does this. The closest attempts are academic prototypes. We're pilot-ready and looking for a partner who operates at the intersection of waste management and autonomous technology -- which describes BEEAH precisely.

Sharjah would be an ideal pilot site: your operational infrastructure, your smart city ambitions, and the regional visibility of a UAE launch.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a joint pilot program?** I can share our full technical specs and a Sharjah-specific deployment proposal.

## Email 3: Municipality of Amsterdam — Clean & Waste Free Framework

**To:** Gemeente Amsterdam — Stadsbeheer (City Management) or the team leading the "Schoon en Afvalvrij" (Clean & Waste Free) Framework 2025-2028 (check gemeente.amsterdam.nl for the right contact)

**Subject:** Autonome afvalrobot voor Amsterdam -- past binnen uw Schoon & Afvalvrij kader

*(Translation: Autonomous litter robot for Amsterdam -- fits within your Clean & Waste Free framework)*

**Body:**

Geachte [Name],

My name is Maurits Bos -- I'm Dutch, and I'm the founder of CleanWalker Robotics. I'm writing because Amsterdam's "Clean & Waste Free Framework 2025-2028" aligns directly with what we've built.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. It uses AI to detect litter, walks across grass, gravel, cobblestones, and park paths, and collects items autonomously 20+ hours a day. Waste is bagged and left at the curb for regular collection -- no new infrastructure.

Amsterdam is ideal for a pilot: the city's commitment to cleanliness innovation, its parks and canal-side paths, and the progressive approach to smart city technology. We're seeking one European city to run a 10-unit pilot in 2027 -- Amsterdam is our first choice.

This would make Amsterdam the first city in the world to deploy a quadrupedal litter robot. That's a story worth telling.

**Would you be open to a 20-minute introductory call?** Happy to present in Dutch or English.

## Notes for Maurits

- **LinkedIn first:** Before sending any of these, connect with the target contact on LinkedIn with a brief note. Warm intros convert 5-10x better than cold email.
- **Veolia is highest priority.** They've already validated the concept. This is a warm lead disguised as a cold one.
- **Amsterdam email uses Dutch subject line deliberately** -- it signals you're local/Dutch, which immediately differentiates from the flood of English-only cold emails they receive.
- **Don't attach the pitch deck on first email.** Keep it lightweight. Send the deck after they agree to a call.
- **Track all outreach in `docs/ceo/outreach-tracker.md`** once you send.
