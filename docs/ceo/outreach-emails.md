## Email 1: Veolia ANZ — Bondi Beach Quadruped Trial

**To:** Veolia Australia/New Zealand — Innovation or Environmental Services lead (research exact contact on LinkedIn; look for the team behind the Bondi Beach "Scoop Doggy Dog" robot trial)

**Subject:** Your Bondi Beach robot dog trial -- we built the commercial version

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. I'm reaching out because of your quadruped litter-collection trial at Bondi Beach -- the "Scoop Doggy Dog" project. That trial proved the concept works. We're building the commercial product.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, all-terrain locomotion (grass, sand, cobblestones, stairs), and a bag cassette system that integrates with existing waste collection routes. No new infrastructure needed.

We've completed our perception pipeline (YOLO-trained on 25,000+ litter images), full hardware architecture, and detailed cost modelling. We're now seeking a pilot partner to deploy 10 units at a real site.

Veolia is the obvious partner -- you've already tested this exact technology category, and you operate in 56 countries. A successful pilot together could scale globally across your contract portfolio.

**Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss a pilot program?** Happy to share our technical specs and a site-specific proposal.

## Email 2: BEEAH Group — Smart City Autonomous Cleaning

**To:** BEEAH Digital or BEEAH Tandeef leadership (research on LinkedIn; BEEAH Digital handles future tech, Tandeef handles city cleaning operations)

**Subject:** Autonomous quadruped litter robot for Sharjah -- aligns with your smart city vision

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. BEEAH's work in autonomous city cleaning and smart waste management -- from your AI City Vision system to your AI-driven headquarters -- is exactly the environment our robot is built for.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. It uses AI vision to detect litter, walks any terrain (parks, plazas, sand, stairs), picks up items from cigarette butts to bottles, and bags waste for existing collection routes. Fully autonomous, 20+ hours per day.

No other commercial product does this. The closest attempts are academic prototypes. We're pilot-ready and looking for a partner who operates at the intersection of waste management and autonomous technology -- which describes BEEAH precisely.

Sharjah would be an ideal pilot site: your operational infrastructure, your smart city ambitions, and the regional visibility of a UAE launch.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a joint pilot program?** I can share our full technical specs and a Sharjah-specific deployment proposal.

## Email 3: Municipality of Amsterdam — Clean & Waste Free Framework

**To:** Gemeente Amsterdam — Stadsbeheer (City Management) or the team leading the "Schoon en Afvalvrij" (Clean & Waste Free) Framework 2025-2028 (check gemeente.amsterdam.nl for the right contact)

**Subject:** Autonome afvalrobot voor Amsterdam -- past binnen uw Schoon & Afvalvrij kader

*(Translation: Autonomous litter robot for Amsterdam -- fits within your Clean & Waste Free framework)*

**Body:**

Geachte [Name],

My name is Maurits Bos -- I'm Dutch, and I'm the founder of CleanWalker Robotics. I'm writing because Amsterdam's "Clean & Waste Free Framework 2025-2028" aligns directly with what we've built.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. It uses AI to detect litter, walks across grass, gravel, cobblestones, and park paths, and collects items autonomously 20+ hours a day. Waste is bagged and left at the curb for regular collection -- no new infrastructure.

Amsterdam is ideal for a pilot: the city's commitment to cleanliness innovation, its parks and canal-side paths, and the progressive approach to smart city technology. We're seeking one European city to run a 10-unit pilot in 2027 -- Amsterdam is our first choice.

This would make Amsterdam the first city in the world to deploy a quadrupedal litter robot. That's a story worth telling.

**Would you be open to a 20-minute introductory call?** Happy to present in Dutch or English.

## Notes for Maurits (Tier 1)

- **LinkedIn first:** Before sending any of these, connect with the target contact on LinkedIn with a brief note. Warm intros convert 5-10x better than cold email.
- **Veolia is highest priority.** They've already validated the concept. This is a warm lead disguised as a cold one.
- **Amsterdam email uses Dutch subject line deliberately** -- it signals you're local/Dutch, which immediately differentiates from the flood of English-only cold emails they receive.
- **Don't attach the pitch deck on first email.** Keep it lightweight. Send the deck after they agree to a call.
- **Track all outreach in `docs/ceo/outreach-tracker.md`** once you send.

**Subject:** Quadrupedal litter robot for Copenhagen -- built for your Solutions Lab testing program

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Copenhagen's Solutions Lab has built one of Europe's best frameworks for testing smart city technology in real urban environments. We'd like to bring our robot through it.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, all-terrain locomotion (grass, cobblestones, park paths, stairs), and a bag cassette system that integrates with existing waste collection. Fully autonomous, 20+ hours per day.

Copenhagen is a natural fit: your Solutions Lab provides the structured testing environment we need, your cycling infrastructure means pedestrian areas need cleaner alternatives to heavy vehicles, and Denmark's progressive stance on urban innovation attracts global attention.

A pilot in Copenhagen wouldn't just test our technology -- it would position the city as the first in Scandinavia to deploy an autonomous litter-collecting quadruped.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a pilot through Solutions Lab?** Happy to share our technical specs and a Copenhagen-specific proposal.

## Email 5: City of Helsinki — Forum Virium & Trombia Follow-Up

**To:** City of Helsinki — Smart City or Environment & Urban Development lead (research on LinkedIn; also check Forum Virium Helsinki for innovation contacts)

**Subject:** Autonomous litter robot for Helsinki -- you already piloted Trombia, here's the next step

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Helsinki's pilot of the Trombia autonomous sweeper proved the city is ready for robotic street cleaning. We've built the technology that goes where Trombia can't -- off the road.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI vision detects litter, four-legged locomotion handles parks, plazas, grass, gravel, and stairs, and waste is bagged for existing collection routes. Fully autonomous, 20+ hours per day.

Helsinki is ideal: Forum Virium's smart city testbed culture, Finland's permissive robotics regulations, and the city's track record with autonomous outdoor vehicles. Trombia handles roads -- CleanWalker handles everything roads can't reach.

Together, Helsinki could become the first city with a complete autonomous cleaning ecosystem: vehicles for streets, quadrupeds for green spaces.

**Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss a pilot?** I can share our technical specs and a Helsinki-specific deployment plan.

**Subject:** Robot cuadrúpedo autónomo para Barcelona -- encaja en el contrato Cuidem Barcelona

*(Translation: Autonomous quadruped robot for Barcelona -- fits the Cuidem Barcelona contract)*

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Barcelona's EUR 2.3 billion Cuidem Barcelona cleaning contract specifically mentions service robots as part of the city's future cleaning strategy. We've built exactly that.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, all-terrain locomotion (parks, plazas, beaches, cobblestones, stairs), and a bag cassette system that integrates with existing waste collection. Fully autonomous, 20+ hours per day.

Barcelona is a perfect pilot city: the Cuidem Barcelona contract creates a procurement pathway for our technology, the city hosts Smart City Expo World Congress giving global visibility to any pilot, and Barcelona's parks and beachfront are exactly the terrain our quadruped is designed for.

We're seeking one Mediterranean city for a 2027 pilot. Barcelona is our first choice.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about integrating CleanWalker into the Cuidem Barcelona program?** Happy to share our full technical specs.

**Subject:** Autonomous litter robot live demo at ICRA 2026 Vienna -- partnership with MA48?

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Vienna is hosting ICRA 2026 (June 1--5) -- the world's largest robotics conference. We're building the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter robot, and we'd like to demo it in Vienna in partnership with MA48.

CleanWalker uses AI vision to detect litter, walks any terrain (parks, cobblestones, paths, stairs), and collects waste autonomously 20+ hours per day. Waste is bagged for existing collection routes -- no new infrastructure.

MA48 swept 10,291 tons of street waste in 2023. Our robot is designed to augment that workforce, handling green spaces and pedestrian areas where heavy vehicles can't operate.

The timing is perfect: a live pilot during ICRA 2026 would put Vienna and MA48 at the centre of the global robotics conversation. Every major robotics researcher and company will be in your city that week.

**Would you have 20 minutes to discuss a pilot timed around ICRA?** Happy to present to the MA48 team.

## Email 8: Emaar Properties Dubai — Downtown Dubai Premium Spaces

**To:** Emaar Properties — Innovation, Facilities Management, or Community Management lead (research on LinkedIn; look for someone overseeing Downtown Dubai or Emaar's smart community initiatives)

**Subject:** Autonomous litter robot for Downtown Dubai -- premium tech for premium spaces

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Emaar's properties -- Downtown Dubai, Dubai Marina, the Burj Khalifa promenades -- represent some of the world's most visible outdoor spaces. We've built a robot designed specifically for environments where appearance matters.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, four-legged locomotion across any surface (pavement, grass, landscaped areas, stairs), and autonomous operation 20+ hours per day. Silent, sleek, and designed to impress rather than intrude.

For Emaar, CleanWalker isn't just a cleaning tool -- it's a story. A quadruped robot patrolling the Burj Khalifa boulevard is the kind of premium, forward-thinking image that reinforces Emaar's brand. It's PR that generates itself.

We're seeking one premium property partner in the Gulf region for a 2027 pilot. Emaar is the obvious choice.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a pilot at one of your properties?** I can share a site-specific proposal.

## Timing (Tier 2)

- **Copenhagen:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM CET. Avoid Danish holidays and summer (late June-August).
- **Helsinki:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 10-11 AM EET. Avoid Finnish holidays and midsummer (late June).
- **Barcelona:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM CET. Avoid August (city largely on holiday) and around Smart City Expo (November -- save for in-person follow-up).
- **Vienna:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM CET. Time around ICRA 2026 announcement cycle (send March-April for June conference relevance).
- **Emaar Dubai:** Send Sunday-Tuesday, 9-10 AM GST (UAE work week). Avoid Ramadan and Friday/Saturday (weekend).

## Notes for Maurits (Tier 2)

- **Vienna is time-sensitive.** ICRA 2026 is June 1-5 -- if you want a pilot timed around the conference, outreach needs to happen by March-April at the latest.
- **Barcelona's Spanish subject line** signals effort and respect. The body stays in English since most city officials at this level are comfortable with it.
- **Helsinki is a strong follow-on to Trombia.** Position CleanWalker as complementary, not competitive -- Trombia does roads, we do everything else.
- **Emaar is the only private-sector target here.** The pitch angle is different: it's about brand, PR, and premium image, not municipal efficiency. Lean into that.
- **Copenhagen Solutions Lab has a formal application process.** Research whether they have an open call for proposals and align your outreach with their intake cycle.
- **Same rules as Tier 1:** LinkedIn first, no attachments on first email, track in `docs/ceo/outreach-tracker.md`.

## Email 9: Majid Al Futtaim / Enova — Veolia JV & Smart Facilities

**To:** Enova (Majid Al Futtaim–Veolia JV) — Facilities Innovation or Operations lead; alternatively Majid Al Futtaim Launchpad Accelerator team (research on LinkedIn; look for FM innovation contacts or Launchpad program managers)

**Subject:** Autonomous litter robot for your properties -- Veolia connection, startup-ready

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Enova -- the Majid Al Futtaim–Veolia joint venture -- sits at the intersection of premium property management and smart technology adoption. We've built a robot designed for exactly that intersection.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, all-terrain locomotion (landscaped areas, plazas, pathways, stairs), and autonomous operation 20+ hours per day. Silent and designed for guest-facing environments.

Majid Al Futtaim is already deploying robots at Dubai Festival City through Emrill. CleanWalker extends that vision to outdoor spaces -- the promenades, gardens, and open-air retail zones where wheeled robots can't go. And with Veolia as your JV partner, you already understand autonomous waste technology.

We're also a fit for the MAF Launchpad Accelerator if there's an open cohort.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a pilot at one of your properties?** Happy to share a site-specific proposal.

## Email 10: City of Sydney — Open Space Investment & Carbon Neutrality

**To:** City of Sydney — City Greening or Sustainability lead (research on LinkedIn; look for contacts in the Greening Sydney Plan or Environmental Strategy team)

**Subject:** Autonomous litter robot for Sydney's parks -- AUD 2.7B open space, zero emissions

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Sydney's AUD 2.7 billion open space investment and carbon-neutral targets signal a city that's serious about how public spaces are maintained. We've built a robot that fits both priorities.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, all-terrain locomotion (grass, sand, park paths, harbour foreshore, stairs), and fully electric operation -- zero direct emissions, 20+ hours per day.

Sydney's parks, beaches, and harbourside promenades are exactly the terrain our quadruped is designed for. Areas too uneven for wheeled robots, too large for manual teams alone. And Veolia already operates across Australia and New Zealand -- a potential operational partner you already work with.

A pilot in Sydney would make it the first Australian city to deploy an autonomous litter-collecting quadruped. That's global headlines.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a pilot in one of Sydney's open spaces?** Happy to share a site-specific proposal.

## Email 11: City of Melbourne — Emerging Technology Testbed & Smart Bins

**To:** City of Melbourne — Smart City Office or Urban Sustainability lead (research on LinkedIn; look for contacts managing the Emerging Technology Testbed program or the smart bins rollout)

**Subject:** Quadrupedal litter robot for Melbourne -- built for your Emerging Technology Testbed

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Melbourne's Emerging Technology Testbed program exists to trial exactly this kind of technology -- autonomous systems that improve urban liveability. We'd like to bring our robot through it.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI vision detects litter, four-legged locomotion handles grass, gravel, garden paths, and stairs, and waste is bagged for existing collection routes. Fully electric, 20+ hours per day.

Melbourne is already investing in smart waste infrastructure -- your sensor-equipped smart bins pilot proves the appetite for technology-driven cleanliness. CleanWalker is the next step: autonomous collection between the bins. The Royal Botanic Gardens alone would be an ideal pilot site -- high-profile, varied terrain, and thousands of daily visitors.

Your Testbed program provides the structured trial framework we need, and Melbourne gets to be the first Australian city with a litter-collecting quadruped.

**Would you have 20 minutes to discuss a Testbed application?** Happy to share our technical specs.

## Email 12: University of Texas at Austin — NSF Robotics Grant & Campus Deployment

**To:** UT Austin — Texas Robotics faculty lead or Office of Research (research on LinkedIn; look for PIs on the NSF "Living and Working with Robots" grant or robotics dept leadership)

**Subject:** Commercial litter quadruped for UT Austin -- co-publication + campus deployment

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. UT Austin's USD 3.6 million NSF "Living and Working with Robots" grant is studying exactly what we've built: an autonomous robot that operates alongside people in everyday environments.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection trained on 25,000+ litter images, all-terrain locomotion (grass, paths, plazas, stairs), and fully autonomous operation. UT Austin already has autonomous robots on campus -- adding a litter-collecting quadruped is a natural extension.

We're offering a research partnership: deploy CleanWalker units on the UT Austin campus, share our perception and locomotion data with Texas Robotics, and co-publish on real-world autonomous robot operation in populated environments. You get a live research platform; we get validation from a world-class robotics department.

This isn't a sponsorship request. It's a research collaboration with a commercial robot that's already built.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a campus pilot and co-publication framework?**

## Email 13: Walt Disney Parks & Resorts — Zero Waste Goal & Guest Experience

**To:** Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Products — Environmental Sustainability or Imagineering Operations lead (research on LinkedIn; look for contacts in Disney's environmental programs or theme park innovation teams)

**Subject:** Litter-collecting robot for Disney Parks -- zero waste, guest attraction, brand magic

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm Maurits Bos, founder of CleanWalker Robotics. Disney has committed to zero waste to landfill by 2030 and is investing USD 60 billion in parks over the next decade. We've built a robot that serves both goals -- and creates a new guest experience in the process.

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI-powered detection, four-legged locomotion across any terrain (landscaping, pathways, plazas, stairs), and silent autonomous operation 20+ hours per day.

But here's the Disney angle: a quadruped robot picking up litter isn't just a cleaning tool -- it's a character. Guests will stop, watch, film, and share it. It's a walking embodiment of Disney's environmental commitment that generates organic social media content every single day.

You've already proven this instinct with themed trash cans that became fan favourites. CleanWalker is the autonomous, living version.

**Would you have 20 minutes for a call about a pilot at one of your parks?** Happy to share a themed deployment concept.

## Timing (Tier 2 — Emails 9-13)

- **Majid Al Futtaim / Enova:** Send Sunday-Tuesday, 9-10 AM GST (UAE work week). Avoid Ramadan and Friday/Saturday (weekend).
- **City of Sydney:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM AEDT. Avoid Australian holiday season (late December-January) and Easter week.
- **City of Melbourne:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM AEDT. Same Australian holiday guidance. Check Emerging Technology Testbed intake cycle.
- **UT Austin:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM CT. Avoid finals weeks (May, December) and spring break. Academic outreach best during semester (Feb-April, Sep-Nov).
- **Walt Disney Parks:** Send Tuesday-Wednesday, 9-10 AM ET. Avoid Thanksgiving-Christmas peak season (Nov-Jan) when park ops teams are slammed.

## Notes for Maurits (Tier 2 — Emails 9-13)

- **Majid Al Futtaim has dual entry points:** Enova (the Veolia JV) for facilities management, and the MAF Launchpad Accelerator for startup partnerships. Try both angles.
- **Sydney and Melbourne are a natural pair.** If one Australian city says yes, use that momentum to approach the other. Lead with whichever responds first.
- **UT Austin is a different pitch entirely.** This is research partnership, not a sales email. Emphasise co-publication and data sharing, not cost savings.
- **Disney is high-risk, high-reward.** Long sales cycles, many gatekeepers, but a Disney pilot would be the single most valuable brand validation possible. Be patient and persistent.
- **The Veolia connection threads through multiple targets** (Enova, Sydney, Melbourne). If you land a Veolia relationship through Tier 1 outreach, leverage it across all Veolia-adjacent Tier 2 targets.
- **Same rules as always:** LinkedIn first, no attachments on first email, track in `docs/ceo/outreach-tracker.md`.
