# CleanWalker — Strategic Direction

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Current Phase: Pre-Revenue Digital Prototyping

### Core Principle
Zero physical spend until a deal is signed and money is in the bank. Everything digital first — simulation, CAD, ML training, renders.

### Priority Stack

**Tier 1 — Completed (Foundation):**
1. ~~Website live~~ (DONE — cleanwalkerrobotics.com, 14 pages, 9 demos, WebGPU AI detection)
2. ~~Full cost model~~ (DONE — revised financial model + pricing sheet)
3. ~~Global market research~~ (DONE — 5 regional reports + competitive landscape)
4. ~~Perception model v1~~ (DONE — YOLO26 pipeline + client-side WebGPU demo on website)
5. ~~Pitch deck + financial model~~ (DONE — 15 slides, 5-year projections)
6. ~~Outreach emails + proposals~~ (DONE — 13 emails + 3 proposals + 13 one-pagers)
7. ~~Robot design spec V2.3~~ (DONE — full ratios, bag system, render prompts, V3 renders)

**Tier 1 — Active:**
8. **OUTREACH EMAILS** — IN PROGRESS (Tier 1: BEEAH, Amsterdam, Veolia scheduled; Tier 2: 10 emails queued for Feb 13-14)
9. **SRTIP SAIA application** — Applications open Feb 22, deadline May 9. Waste Management & Circularity focus. Draft ready.
10. **WBSO R&D tax credit application** — Apply for next period ASAP. Up to €48K/yr at 50% starter rate. Need eHerkenning + tax advisor.
11. **EU regulatory compliance planning** — Start EN ISO 12100 risk assessment, engage TUV SUD for early NB consultation. ML perception = safety function → mandatory Notified Body (no self-cert). 12-24 month certification timeline.

**Tier 2 — This month:**
12. MIT Haalbaarheid application prep (April 8 opening — lottery, must be ready day 1)
13. Simulation demo video (URDF + IsaacLab pipeline ready, needs ~$6 GPU time on Vast.ai)
14. BV conversion consultation (€500-2K, removes all NL grant eligibility ambiguity)
15. Render accuracy improvement via 3D pipeline (text-to-image hit its limits)

**Tier 3 — After signed deal:**
16. Physical prototype build (~3 iterations to pilot-ready)
17. Dashboard app (fleet management)
18. Fleet coordinator service
19. Production firmware
20. Full EU CE marking certification (EUR 75-250K, see Regulatory Compliance section)

### Key Decisions Made
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-09 | Dashboard app deprioritized | No customers = no fleet to manage |
| 2026-02-09 | Digital-first prototyping | No capital for physical builds yet |
| 2026-02-09 | AGPL-3.0 license | Open source with strong copyleft |
| 2026-02-09 | Austin TX as US pilot city | SF caps at 3 devices; TX preempts local PDD regulation; Austin already has Avride robots |
| 2026-02-09 | RaaS at $3,000-3,500/mo target pricing | Still 55-65% cheaper than human labor; well within gov budgets |
| 2026-02-09 | Tariff mitigation priority | Chinese actuators hit with ~49% stacked tariffs; engage customs broker |
| 2026-02-09 | Global market entry strategy | Phase 1: EU (Netherlands) + UAE. Phase 2: UK + Australia + Singapore. Phase 3: US + Japan + Korea |
| 2026-02-09 | Veolia = #1 strategic partner | Already trialed quadruped litter robots at Bondi Beach; 56 countries; EUR 45B revenue |
| 2026-02-10 | Netherlands as EU entry point (not Germany) | Dutch founder advantage, easier municipal permits, WBSO grants (€48K/yr), no IFAT dependency |
| 2026-02-10 | Don't use Unitree Go2 as platform | Too expensive at scale ($18K vs $7-9K), no IP rating. Learn from their open-source (IsaacLab, rsl_rl) |
| 2026-02-11 | Dual-track funding: NL (R&D) + UAE (market access) | WBSO/MIT/VFF fund development; SRTIP/MBRIF provide partnerships and pilot access |
| 2026-02-11 | Start EU Machinery Reg compliance early | ML perception = safety function → mandatory Notified Body. 12-24 month timeline. First-mover CE certification moat |

### Global Market Intelligence

**TAM/SAM/SOM:**

### Dual-Track Funding Strategy

**Netherlands — R&D Funding (develop the technology):**
| Program | Amount | Timeline | Status |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| WBSO R&D tax credit | Up to €48K/yr (50% starter rate) | Rolling monthly | Application draft ready |
| MIT Haalbaarheid | Up to €20K | April 8, 2026 opening | Preparing application |
| VFF Proof-of-Concept | Up to €450K loan | Year-round | Needs investor LOI |
| MIA/Vamil | 27-45% tax deduction on hardware | When purchasing | Ready when buying |
| **Cumulative NL (best-case)** | **€531-540K** | | |

**UAE — Market Access (deploy the product):**
| Program | Amount | Timeline | Status |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| SRTIP SAIA Accelerator | Free + prototyping access | Feb 22 – May 9 apps | Application draft ready |
| Hub71+ ClimateTech | AED 500-750K (~$136-204K) | Next cohort TBD | Feb 15 deadline passed |
| MBRIF Accelerator | Equity-free + loan guarantee | Cohort 12 TBD | Monitoring |
| Sheraa | AED 35K + free Sharjah license | Next cohort TBD | Needs traction first |
| DFA | Gov partnership + pilot | When waste/robotics challenge opens | Monitoring |
| **Cumulative UAE (best-case)** | **AED 2.7-7.4M ($735K-$2.0M)** | | |

**Why dual-track:** NL funds R&D via grants and tax credits (WBSO approval = credibility signal for investors). UAE provides market access via accelerators (SRTIP → BEEAH proximity, DFA → Dubai Municipality pilot). Use NL prototype progress to qualify for UAE pilot programs. Use UAE government partnerships to attract NL investors (VFF matching).

### EU Regulatory Compliance

**EU Machinery Regulation 2023/1230 — effective 20 January 2027, NO transition period.**

**Critical finding:** CleanWalker's ML-based perception pipeline serves as the primary collision avoidance system (a safety function). This places the robot under **Annex I, Part A, categories 5/6** — requiring **mandatory Notified Body involvement**. Self-certification (Module A) is NOT available.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Classification | High-risk: ML ensuring safety functions (Annex I Part A, Cat 5/6) |
| Conformity assessment | Module B+C (EU Type-Examination) — requires Notified Body |
| Recommended NB | TUV SUD (first designated under new reg, AMR experience) |
| Cost estimate | EUR 75,000-250,000 first year; EUR 25,000-80,000/yr ongoing |
| Timeline | 12-24 months from start of conformity process |
| Cybersecurity | IEC 62443 SL2/SL3 required; CRA compliance by Dec 2027 |
| AI Act | High-risk AI (Art 6(1)) — full application Aug 2026, extended transition Aug 2027 |
| Battery Regulation | Digital battery passport required Feb 2027 |

**First-mover advantage:** No competitor has CE-certified an autonomous outdoor litter-picking robot. All certified AMRs (ADLATUS, Gausium, Karcher KIRA, Nexaro) are indoor-only. CE marking creates a 9-18 month competitive moat and is a legal prerequisite for EU municipal tenders.

**Strategy:** Begin risk assessment and NB engagement now. Start with NL/FI/EE for municipal pilot permits (most permissive). Target CE marking by mid-2027.

See: `docs/research/eu-machinery-regulation-compliance.md`

### Competitive Position (updated 2026-02-11)

**Still no commercial competitor.** No quadrupedal litter-collecting robot exists commercially. Our competitive score: 8.0 vs next-best 5.9 (VERO, academic only).

| Moat | Status |
|------|--------|
| First-to-market in category | Maintained — no new entrants |
| CE certification opportunity | No competitor CE-certified for outdoor autonomous litter picking |
| Perception stack completeness | Full pipeline researched and architected (6 subsystems) |
| Digital prototype depth | Website, demos, URDF, IsaacLab, sales materials — all complete |
| Municipal relationships | Outreach to 13 targets in progress |
| Dual EU+UAE strategy | Unique positioning — NL grants + UAE market access |
