# CleanWalker — Strategic Direction

Last updated: 2026-02-09

## Current Phase: Pre-Revenue Digital Prototyping

### Core Principle
Zero physical spend until a deal is signed and money is in the bank. Everything digital first — simulation, CAD, ML training, renders.

### Priority Stack

**Tier 1 — Now:**
1. Website live (DONE — cleanwalkerrobotics.vercel.app)
2. Full cost model (hardware BOM + ML compute + operational costs)
3. Perception model v1 (YOLO trained on TACO/TrashNet — provable AI demo)
4. Hardware architecture decisions (documented in ADRs)

**Tier 2 — This month:**
5. Robot CAD model + URDF for simulation
6. Simulation demo video (Gazebo/Isaac Sim)
7. Pitch deck + financial model
8. First municipal outreach (cold emails + grant applications)

**Tier 3 — After signed deal:**
9. Physical prototype build
10. Dashboard app (fleet management)
11. Fleet coordinator service
12. Production firmware

### Key Decisions Made
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-09 | Dashboard app deprioritized | No customers = no fleet to manage |
| 2026-02-09 | Digital-first prototyping | No capital for physical builds yet |
| 2026-02-09 | AGPL-3.0 license | Open source with strong copyleft |

### What We Need to Close First Deal
1. Professional website with robot renders (not stock photos)
2. Simulation video showing the robot detecting + picking up trash
3. Live AI demo (trash detection on real video footage)
4. Detailed cost proposal with per-unit and fleet pricing
5. Pilot proposal: 3 units, 1 zone, 3 months, clear KPIs
