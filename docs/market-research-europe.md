## 3. EU Regulatory Path

### 3.1 EU Machinery Regulation 2023/1230

The new Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 replaces the old Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC and is a **regulation** (directly applicable) rather than a directive.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Application date** | **January 20, 2027** |
| **Transition** | Products placed on market before Jan 20, 2027 can comply with old Directive; after that date, the Regulation is mandatory |
| **Key new requirements for CleanWalker** | (1) Autonomy thresholds, (2) Lifetime cybersecurity responsibilities, (3) Collaborative risk mapping |
| **AI safety functions** | If AI/ML ensures safety functions, assessment must be carried out by a **notified body** (third-party conformity assessment mandatory) |
| **Cybersecurity** | Safety control systems must be protected against cyber threats |
| **Autonomous mobile machinery** | Explicitly covered for the first time; must address risks from autonomous behavior, self-evolving behavior |
| **Guide to application** | Final version expected end of 2026; drafts on selected topics available early 2026 |

**CleanWalker implications:** As a quadrupedal robot with AI-driven navigation and litter detection operating in public spaces, CleanWalker will be classified as **high-risk machinery** under the new Regulation. Third-party conformity assessment by a notified body (e.g., TUV, DEKRA, SGS) will be mandatory. Plan for 12-18 months of certification work.

### 3.2 CE Marking Requirements and Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Action Required |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Current (until Jan 2027)** | Now - Jan 20, 2027 | Can still self-certify under Directive 2006/42/EC for non-high-risk categories |
| **New Regulation** | From Jan 20, 2027 | Must comply with Regulation 2023/1230. For autonomous robots with AI safety functions, mandatory third-party assessment |
| **Harmonized standards** | Expected late 2026 | New harmonized standards under the Regulation being developed |
| **Amending Regulation** | May 29, 2026 | Regulation (EU) 2024/2748 applies, potentially adding requirements |

**Recommended approach:** Begin conformity assessment process NOW under current Directive (self-certification possible), while simultaneously preparing documentation for the new Regulation. Engage a notified body early.

### 3.3 GDPR Implications for Robots with Cameras

CleanWalker's sensors (cameras, LiDAR) will capture data in public spaces, triggering GDPR obligations:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Legal basis** | Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)) most likely basis; consent impractical in public spaces |
| **Data minimization** | Capture only what is necessary for navigation and litter detection; blur/anonymize faces in real-time |
| **Transparency** | Must provide information to data subjects at the point of collection (Art. 13); signage on the robot and in the operating area |
| **DPIA** | Data Protection Impact Assessment required for systematic monitoring of public areas |
| **AI Act interaction** | EU AI Act (effective August 2024) prohibits real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces; ensure CleanWalker's cameras do NOT perform facial recognition |
| **Data retention** | Minimize retention; delete navigation/environmental data as soon as operationally feasible |
| **Cross-border** | If operating in multiple EU countries, lead supervisory authority depends on main establishment |

**Key risk:** The EU AI Act's prohibition on real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces means CleanWalker must ensure its visual processing pipeline demonstrably does NOT identify individuals.
