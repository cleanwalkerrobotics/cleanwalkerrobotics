# CleanWalker Robot — AI Render Prompts

**Purpose:** Generate photorealistic marketing renders for website, pitch deck, and sales materials.
**Tool:** Seedream 4.5 (bytedance/seedream-4.5) via Replicate API at 2560x1440 (16:9).
**Style:** Clean, professional, photorealistic product photography. Think Boston Dynamics Spot marketing meets Apple product shots.

## Design Brief

**Robot appearance:**
- Quadrupedal (4 legs), dog-sized (~50cm tall at body, ~80cm long)
- Sleek, matte dark gray/charcoal body with green accent lines (CleanWalker brand green #22c55e)
- Rounded, weatherproof enclosure (IP65 look — sealed panels, no visible screws)
- Visible sensors: front stereo camera (OAK-D style — two lens circles + IR dot projector), small 2D LiDAR puck on top
- Small robotic arm on the front/underside with a soft gripper (3-finger, silicone look) — doubles as bag compressor
- **Bag Cassette System** mounted on top of robot:
  - X-shaped metal frame that raises (collection mode) and lowers flat (transport mode)
  - Square rim frame at the top holds a standard trash bag open when raised — gives the robot a distinctive tall silhouette
  - Internal replaceable bag roll cassette (cartridge-style, slots into the body)
  - When bag is full: snap-close mechanism seals the bag, frame lowers, robot drops sealed bag at nearest curb
  - Frame rises again with a fresh bag from the roll, continues collecting
- Rubber foot pads on each leg
- Status LED strip along the side (green = operating)
- Small antenna nub (cellular)
- Overall aesthetic: utilitarian but modern, like a Unitree Go2 crossed with a Dyson product, with a distinctive raised bag frame silhouette during collection

## Hero Shots (Website Homepage)

### 1. Hero — Robot in Park Setting
```
Photorealistic product photo of an autonomous quadrupedal litter-collecting robot in a clean urban park. The robot is matte charcoal gray with green LED accent lines, has four articulated legs with rubber foot pads, a front-mounted stereo camera system, and a small robotic arm with soft silicone gripper picking up a plastic bottle. On top of the robot, an X-shaped metal frame is raised upward holding a standard trash bag open with a square rim — the bag is partially filled with collected litter. The raised bag frame gives the robot a distinctive tall silhouette. Morning golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, green grass and trees in background. Professional product photography style. 8K, ultra detailed.
```

### 2. Hero — Robot on City Sidewalk
```
Photorealistic render of a sleek autonomous quadrupedal robot walking on a clean European city sidewalk. Matte dark gray body with green accent lighting, four articulated legs in walking pose, stereo camera eyes on the front, small LiDAR sensor on top. On the robot's back, a raised X-shaped metal frame holds a trash bag open with a square rim, giving the robot a distinctive tall silhouette. The robot is about the size of a medium dog. Modern architecture and cobblestone street in the background. Overcast sky, soft diffused lighting. Professional product photography, studio quality. 8K.
```

### 3. Hero — Fleet of Robots Working
```
Photorealistic wide-angle photo of three autonomous quadrupedal robots working in a large urban park, picking up litter. The robots are matte charcoal with green LED strips, each about dog-sized with four legs. Each robot has a raised X-shaped metal frame on its back holding open a trash bag with a square rim. One robot is picking up a can with its small robotic arm, another is walking with its bag nearly full, and the third has its frame lowered flat — dropping a sealed full bag at the curb before reloading a fresh one. Drone perspective, morning light, professional marketing photo. Ultra detailed, 8K.

## Product Detail Shots (Product Page)

### 4. Close-up — Gripper Picking Up Litter
```
Extreme close-up photorealistic render of a robotic soft gripper made of translucent silicone, with three fingers gently grasping a crushed aluminum can. The gripper is attached to a small 2-DOF robotic arm on a matte charcoal quadrupedal robot. In the background, slightly out of focus, the robot's raised X-shaped bag frame holds open a trash bag where collected litter is visible. Shallow depth of field, studio lighting, product photography style. Shows the precision and gentleness of the grip. 8K macro photography.
```

### 5. Close-up — Sensor Array (Front Face)
```
Front view close-up of an autonomous robot's sensor head. Two circular camera lenses (stereo depth camera) with a small IR dot projector between them, mounted on a matte charcoal body panel. A small green LED status indicator glows. Behind and above, the raised X-shaped bag cassette frame is partially visible, holding an open trash bag. Clean industrial design, slightly rounded edges. Studio product photography with soft rim lighting. 8K.
```

### 6. Side Profile — Full Robot
```
Clean side-profile product photo of an autonomous quadrupedal litter robot on a white/light gray studio background. Matte charcoal body with green accent line, four articulated legs in standing pose, visible joints with aluminum hardware, front stereo camera, top-mounted LiDAR puck, small robotic arm folded underneath. On top, the X-shaped bag cassette frame is raised, holding a standard trash bag open with a square metal rim — the robot's most distinctive feature. The internal bag roll cassette is faintly visible through a panel. Professional product photography, even lighting, no shadows. 8K.
```

### 7. Robot at Charging Dock
```
Photorealistic render of an autonomous quadrupedal robot parked on a small charging dock in an urban park setting. The dock is a simple weatherproof platform with a small rain canopy. The robot has green LED strip glowing (charging indicator). The X-shaped bag cassette frame is lowered flat against the body in compact transport mode, giving the robot a low, sleek profile. Pogo pin contacts visible at the base. Clean, modern design. Evening golden hour lighting. 8K.

## Lifestyle / Context Shots (About Page, Social Media)

### 8. Robot and City Worker
```
Photorealistic photo of a city parks maintenance worker in a high-vis vest standing next to an autonomous quadrupedal litter robot, checking a tablet/dashboard. The robot is matte charcoal with green accents, about knee-height, with its X-shaped bag frame raised and holding an open trash bag half-full of collected litter. They are in a well-maintained urban park. The worker looks pleased. Natural daylight, editorial photography style. 8K.
```

### 9. Night Operations
```
Moody photorealistic render of an autonomous quadrupedal robot operating on a city street at night. The robot's green LED status strip illuminates the sidewalk. Its camera sensors glow faintly. Street lamps in the background. The robot is mid-stride with its raised X-shaped bag frame holding an open trash bag — the robotic arm is pressing a piece of litter down into the bag, compacting it. Cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field. 8K.
```

### 10. Before/After — Park Clean-up
```
Split image: Left side shows a park with scattered litter (bottles, cans, wrappers). Right side shows the same park pristine and clean, with a small quadrupedal robot in the distance, its X-shaped bag frame lowered flat, a sealed full bag dropped neatly at the curb behind it. Before/after comparison, bright daylight, professional editorial photography. 8K.
