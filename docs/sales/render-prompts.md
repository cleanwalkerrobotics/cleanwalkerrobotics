# CleanWalker Robot — AI Render Prompts

**Purpose:** Generate photorealistic marketing renders for website, pitch deck, and sales materials.
**Tool:** Use Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, or Flux Pro for best results.
**Style:** Clean, professional, photorealistic product photography. Think Boston Dynamics Spot marketing meets Apple product shots.

## Design Brief

**Robot appearance:**
- Quadrupedal (4 legs), dog-sized (~50cm tall at body, ~80cm long)
- Sleek, matte dark gray/charcoal body with green accent lines (CleanWalker brand green #22c55e)
- Rounded, weatherproof enclosure (IP65 look — sealed panels, no visible screws)
- Visible sensors: front stereo camera (OAK-D style — two lens circles + IR dot projector), small 2D LiDAR puck on top
- Small robotic arm on the front/underside with a soft gripper (3-finger, silicone look)
- Compact waste bin integrated into the body (top-loading, ~20L)
- Rubber foot pads on each leg
- Status LED strip along the side (green = operating)
- Small antenna nub (cellular)
- Overall aesthetic: utilitarian but modern, like a Unitree Go2 crossed with a Dyson product

## Hero Shots (Website Homepage)

### 1. Hero — Robot in Park Setting
```
Photorealistic product photo of an autonomous quadrupedal litter-collecting robot in a clean urban park. The robot is matte charcoal gray with green LED accent lines, has four articulated legs with rubber foot pads, a front-mounted stereo camera system, a small robotic arm with soft silicone gripper picking up a plastic bottle, and a compact waste bin on its back. Morning golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, green grass and trees in background. Professional product photography style. 8K, ultra detailed.
```

### 2. Hero — Robot on City Sidewalk
```
Photorealistic render of a sleek autonomous quadrupedal robot walking on a clean European city sidewalk. Matte dark gray body with green accent lighting, four articulated legs in walking pose, stereo camera eyes on the front, small LiDAR sensor on top. The robot is about the size of a medium dog. Modern architecture and cobblestone street in the background. Overcast sky, soft diffused lighting. Professional product photography, studio quality. 8K.
```

### 3. Hero — Fleet of Robots Working
```
Photorealistic wide-angle photo of three autonomous quadrupedal robots working in a large urban park, picking up litter. The robots are matte charcoal with green LED strips, each about dog-sized with four legs. One robot is picking up a can with its small robotic arm, another is walking, and the third is depositing waste into its built-in bin. Drone perspective, morning light, professional marketing photo. Ultra detailed, 8K.

### 4. Close-up — Gripper Picking Up Litter
```
Extreme close-up photorealistic render of a robotic soft gripper made of translucent silicone, with three fingers gently grasping a crushed aluminum can. The gripper is attached to a small 2-DOF robotic arm on a matte charcoal quadrupedal robot. Shallow depth of field, studio lighting, product photography style. Shows the precision and gentleness of the grip. 8K macro photography.
```

### 5. Close-up — Sensor Array (Front Face)
```
Front view close-up of an autonomous robot's sensor head. Two circular camera lenses (stereo depth camera) with a small IR dot projector between them, mounted on a matte charcoal body panel. A small green LED status indicator glows. Clean industrial design, slightly rounded edges. Studio product photography with soft rim lighting. 8K.
```

### 6. Side Profile — Full Robot
```
Clean side-profile product photo of an autonomous quadrupedal litter robot on a white/light gray studio background. Matte charcoal body with green accent line, four articulated legs in standing pose, visible joints with aluminum hardware, front stereo camera, top-mounted LiDAR puck, small robotic arm folded underneath, waste bin hatch on top. Professional product photography, even lighting, no shadows. 8K.
```

### 7. Robot at Charging Dock
```
Photorealistic render of an autonomous quadrupedal robot parked on a small charging dock in an urban park setting. The dock is a simple weatherproof platform with a small rain canopy. The robot has green LED strip glowing (charging indicator). Pogo pin contacts visible at the base. Clean, modern design. Evening golden hour lighting. 8K.

## Lifestyle / Context Shots (About Page, Social Media)

### 8. Robot and City Worker
```
Photorealistic photo of a city parks maintenance worker in a high-vis vest standing next to an autonomous quadrupedal litter robot, checking a tablet/dashboard. The robot is matte charcoal with green accents, about knee-height. They are in a well-maintained urban park. The worker looks pleased. Natural daylight, editorial photography style. 8K.
```

### 9. Night Operations
```
Moody photorealistic render of an autonomous quadrupedal robot operating on a city street at night. The robot's green LED status strip illuminates the sidewalk. Its camera sensors glow faintly. Street lamps in the background. The robot is mid-stride, carrying a plastic bag in its gripper. Cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field. 8K.
```

### 10. Before/After — Park Clean-up
```
Split image: Left side shows a park with scattered litter (bottles, cans, wrappers). Right side shows the same park pristine and clean, with a small quadrupedal robot walking away in the distance, its waste bin full. Before/after comparison, bright daylight, professional editorial photography. 8K.
