## Slide 2: The Problem

### Litter Collection Is Manual, Expensive, and Inconsistent

**The numbers tell the story:**

| The Problem | The Data |
|-------------|----------|
| Global street cleaning spend | **$50-60 billion/year** in labor and equipment |
| Cost per manual litter worker | **$4,660-$6,680/month** (wages + benefits + overhead + supervision) |
| Workers needed per park site | **2-3 workers** to maintain cleanliness across shifts |
| Monthly cost per site (2 workers) | **$9,320-$13,360/month** |
| Labor cost growth | **5-8% annually** -- and accelerating |
| Urbanization trend | **68% of world population** in cities by 2050 (up from 56% today) |

**The pain is real:**

- Chronic labor shortages in sanitation -- cities can't hire enough workers
- Coverage gaps: nights, weekends, holidays, and bad weather leave spaces unattended
- Zero data: no analytics on litter patterns, no route optimization, no performance tracking
- Inconsistent quality: manual collection varies by worker, shift, and day
- Rising costs: minimum wage increases and benefits inflation hit cleaning budgets hardest

**Municipalities and property managers are spending more every year and getting less.**

## Slide 3: The Solution

### An Autonomous Robot That Collects Litter 20+ Hours a Day

[PLACEHOLDER: robot hero image -- CleanWalker quadruped walking through a park, picking up a plastic bottle]

**CleanWalker deploys autonomous quadrupedal robots that:**

- **See** litter using AI-powered computer vision (bottles, cans, wrappers, cups, cigarette butts -- 5g to 500g)
- **Walk** across any terrain -- grass, gravel, cobblestones, curbs, stairs, beaches
- **Pick up** items with a soft-grip robotic arm that handles irregular shapes without crushing
- **Compact** collected litter into an onboard 20L bin (3:1 compaction ratio)
- **Self-charge** by autonomously returning to a docking station
- **Report** everything in real time via a fleet management dashboard

**Delivered as a Service (RaaS):**

No upfront capital. No maintenance headaches. No hiring. Just cleaner spaces.

You pay a monthly fee per robot. We own the hardware, handle all maintenance, push software updates over-the-air, and provide 4G-connected real-time monitoring.

## Slide 11: Competitive Landscape

### No Commercial Quadrupedal Litter Robot Exists Today

| Company | Type | Form Factor | Stage | Funding | Limitation |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|---------|------------|
| **CleanWalker** | Litter collection | **Quadruped** | **Commercial (pilot-ready)** | Pre-seed | -- |
| VERO (IIT Genoa) | Litter collection (cigarette butts) | Quadruped | Academic research | University grant | Research prototype only; not a company |
| Angsa Robotics (Germany) | Litter picking (grass/gravel) | Wheeled | Early-stage startup | Husqvarna-backed | Wheeled -- can't handle stairs, curbs, sand, rough terrain |
| Enway / Bucher Municipal | Street sweeping | Wheeled sweeper | Acquired (2022) | EUR 6.7M pre-acquisition | Sweeps surfaces; doesn't pick discrete litter items |
| Trombia / FAUN Group | Street sweeping | Wheeled sweeper | Acquired | EUR 6M pre-acquisition | Large vehicle form factor; limited to roads |
| Autowise.ai (China) | Autonomous sanitation | Wheeled fleet | Series B | $30M+ | China-only; road sweeping, not litter picking |
