## Slide 2: The Problem

### Litter Collection Is Manual, Expensive, and Inconsistent

**The numbers tell the story:**

| The Problem | The Data |
|-------------|----------|
| Global street cleaning spend | **$50-60 billion/year** in labor and equipment |
| Cost per manual litter worker | **$4,660-$6,680/month** (wages + benefits + overhead + supervision) |
| Workers needed per park site | **2-3 workers** to maintain cleanliness across shifts |
| Monthly cost per site (2 workers) | **$9,320-$13,360/month** |
| Labor cost growth | **5-8% annually** -- and accelerating |
| Urbanization trend | **68% of world population** in cities by 2050 (up from 56% today) |

**The pain is real:**

- Chronic labor shortages in sanitation -- cities can't hire enough workers
- Coverage gaps: nights, weekends, holidays, and bad weather leave spaces unattended
- Zero data: no analytics on litter patterns, no route optimization, no performance tracking
- Inconsistent quality: manual collection varies by worker, shift, and day
- Rising costs: minimum wage increases and benefits inflation hit cleaning budgets hardest

**Municipalities and property managers are spending more every year and getting less.**

## Slide 3: The Solution

### An Autonomous Robot That Collects Litter 20+ Hours a Day

[PLACEHOLDER: robot hero image -- CleanWalker quadruped walking through a park, picking up a plastic bottle]

**CleanWalker deploys autonomous quadrupedal robots that:**

- **See** litter using AI-powered computer vision (bottles, cans, wrappers, cups, cigarette butts -- 5g to 500g)
- **Walk** across any terrain -- grass, gravel, cobblestones, curbs, stairs, beaches
- **Pick up** items with a soft-grip robotic arm that handles irregular shapes without crushing
- **Bag it** using a replaceable Bag Cassette System -- collects into standard trash bags, seals when full, drops at the curb for existing waste collection
- **Self-charge** by autonomously returning to a docking station
- **Report** everything in real time via a fleet management dashboard

**Fully managed. Zero new infrastructure.**

We handle hardware, maintenance, software updates, and real-time monitoring. CleanWalker integrates with your existing waste collection routes -- no special bins, no new workflows, no disruption. Contact us for flexible pricing tailored to your site.

## Slide 4: The Product

### Purpose-Built for Outdoor Litter Collection

[PLACEHOLDER: robot hero image -- annotated product shot with callouts to key components]

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Form factor** | Quadrupedal (4 legs, 12 actuators, 3 DOF per leg) |
| **Weight** | ~30 kg |
| **Perception** | OAK-D Pro stereo depth camera + RPLidar A1 (360-degree safety) |
| **AI compute** | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (67 TOPS) -- real-time YOLO litter detection |
| **Manipulation** | 2-DOF robotic arm with soft silicone gripper (conforms to irregular shapes) |
| **Waste collection** | Bag Cassette System -- motorized X-frame holds standard trash bag open; gripper arm compresses at ~80% capacity; snap-close seals full bag; robot drops sealed bag at curb and deploys fresh bag automatically |
| **Bag capacity** | Replaceable cassette holds ~20-30 bags per cartridge; dramatically increases effective capacity vs. fixed bins |
| **Detectable items** | Bottles, cans, wrappers, cups, cigarette butts, paper (5g-500g) |
| **Runtime** | 4-6 hours continuous operation per charge |
| **Charging** | Self-docking contact charger (~4 hours to full) |
| **Daily coverage** | 20+ hours autonomous operation (self-charging cycles) |
| **Weatherproofing** | IP54+ rated -- operates in light to moderate rain |
| **Connectivity** | 4G LTE always-on telemetry, no WiFi required |
| **Coverage** | 5-10 acres per robot per day (terrain/litter density dependent) |

[PLACEHOLDER: robot in park -- CleanWalker navigating a public park path alongside pedestrians]

**Why legs, not wheels?**

Quadrupedal locomotion goes where wheeled robots can't: park grass, beach sand, cobblestone plazas, curbs, stairs, and uneven terrain. This opens market segments that no wheeled cleaning robot can serve.

**Why bag cassettes, not bins?**

The Bag Cassette System means CleanWalker integrates directly with existing municipal waste collection. Sealed bags are dropped at the curb -- collected by the same trucks on the same routes. No special emptying, no new infrastructure, no workflow changes for operations teams.

## Slide 11: Competitive Landscape

### No Commercial Quadrupedal Litter Robot Exists Today

**Direct competitors (litter picking):**

| Company | Form Factor | Terrain | Litter Types | Stage | Funding | Key Limitation |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **CleanWalker** | **Quadruped** | **Grass, gravel, slopes, stairs, curbs, trails, sand** | **Bottles, cans, wrappers, cups, butts, paper (5g-500g)** | **Pilot-ready** | Pre-seed | -- |
| Angsa Robotics (Germany) | Wheeled | Grass, gravel, flat outdoor only | Small trash (butts, wrappers) | Pilot (Berlin BSR) | EUR 2.78M (Husqvarna Ventures) | Wheeled -- no stairs, curbs, slopes, sand. Limited litter diversity. |
| VERO (IIT Genoa) | Quadruped (Unitree) | Beaches, stairs | Cigarette butts only (vacuum) | Academic research | University grant | Research prototype only. Butts only. No company. |
| TechTics BeachBot (Netherlands) | Wheeled/tracked | Beach sand only | Cigarette butts, cans | Prototype/pilot | TU Delft, Do IoT Fieldlab | Niche (beach only). Small scale. Limited funding. |

**Adjacent competitors (autonomous sweepers -- different category):**

| Company | Form Factor | What It Does | Stage | Funding | Why It's Not Us |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Trombia / FAUN Group | Large vehicle (2,300 kg) | Road sweeping | Commercial pilot | EUR 6M + FAUN acquisition | ~$450K/unit. Roads only. Broad sweeping, not targeted litter picking. |
| Enway / Bucher Municipal | Compact wheeled sweeper | Industrial/road sweeping | Commercial (acquired 2022) | $6.6M pre-acquisition | Sweeps surfaces. No litter detection or manipulation. |
| Gaussian/Gausium (China) | Various wheeled | Indoor commercial cleaning | Commercial at scale (40+ countries) | **$361M** (SoftBank-led) | Primarily **indoor**. No outdoor litter picking. |
| Autowise.ai / WIBOT (China/Switzerland) | Wheeled fleet | Road sweeping | Commercial (Shanghai, EU, US) | $30M+ (JV with Boschung) | Large road sweepers. Different use case entirely. |

**Competitive scoring (weighted):**

| Dimension | CleanWalker | Angsa | VERO | Trombia | Enway | Gaussian |
|-----------|:-----------:|:-----:|:----:|:-------:|:-----:|:--------:|
| Terrain capability (25%) | **10** | 5 | 8 | 3 | 4 | 3 |
| Litter diversity (20%) | **9** | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 |
| AI perception (15%) | **9** | 7 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 5 |
| Autonomy level (15%) | **9** | 8 | 7 | 9 | 9 | 9 |
| Infrastructure integration (10%) | **9** | 4 | 1 | 6 | 7 | 5 |
| Deployment readiness (10%) | 2 | 5 | 1 | 6 | 8 | **10** |
| Funding/resources (5%) | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 7 | **10** |
| **Weighted total** | **8.2** | **5.6** | **4.6** | **4.1** | **4.6** | **4.8** |

**CleanWalker's four defensible moats:**

1. **Terrain moat** -- Quadrupedal locomotion accesses parks, trails, slopes, stairs, and beaches that no wheeled competitor can serve. This is a multi-year engineering barrier.
2. **Infrastructure moat** -- The Bag Cassette System integrates with existing municipal waste collection (bags at curb, existing trucks, existing routes). Competitors haven't solved the "what happens after pickup" problem.
3. **AI perception moat** -- Multi-class YOLO detection across 20+ litter categories. Fleet-wide learning creates a data flywheel: more robots = more training data = better detection = better service.
4. **Market validation** -- Veolia (EUR 45B, 56 countries) already trialed this exact concept ("Scoop Doggy Dog" at Bondi Beach). They want to deploy this technology, not build it. We are the solution they're looking for.

**M&A signal:** Bucher acquired Enway, FAUN acquired Trombia -- confirming strategic value of autonomous cleaning robotics startups to major equipment manufacturers.

## Slide 14: The Ask

### We Want a Pilot Partner Who Believes in the Future of Autonomous Public Spaces

**We're not looking for a "maybe." We're looking for a committed partner.**

CleanWalker is seeking one founding pilot partner -- a municipality, waste management company, or campus operator -- who will deploy 10 robots at a real site and prove this technology in the field.

**For Pilot Partners -- What We're Proposing:**

| What You Commit | What You Get |
|-----------------|-------------|
| A 6-month pilot agreement with upfront commitment | 10 autonomous litter-collecting robots deployed on your site |
| A real site with real litter and real pedestrians | Full onboarding: site survey, dock installation, robot configuration, staff training |
| Active collaboration and feedback throughout the pilot | Real-time fleet dashboard with weekly performance reports |
| Senior stakeholder buy-in before we begin | Measurable cleanliness improvement within Month 1 |
| Intent to scale if the pilot succeeds | A published case study proving autonomous litter collection works |
| | **First-mover advantage** -- be the reference customer the entire industry points to |

**Why commit now?**

- No commercial quadrupedal litter robot exists anywhere in the world -- you would be the first
- Veolia (EUR 45B) already trialed this concept at Bondi Beach -- the demand is validated, the solution doesn't exist yet
- EU Machinery Regulation (Jan 2027) creates a clear regulatory pathway for autonomous outdoor robots
- The founding pilot partner shapes the product -- your feedback directly influences what we build
- Early partners lock in preferred pricing and priority access as we scale

**For Investors -- Seed Round:**

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Raising** | **$1.5M Seed** |
| **Use of funds** | Prototype development, manufacturing setup, first 10 pilot units, Year 1 operations, EU certification, working capital |
| **Milestone** | 10-unit commercial pilot deployed and generating revenue |
| **Path to profitability** | Company-level profitability by Year 3 with 200 deployed units |
| **Total to self-sustaining** | ~$3.2M cumulative through profitability |

**Why this is a compelling investment:**

- Genuine first-mover in a category with zero commercial competitors
- $400M+ already invested in autonomous cleaning robotics by VCs (SoftBank alone put $188M into Gaussian Robotics)
- Major equipment OEMs acquiring autonomous cleaning startups (Bucher/Enway, FAUN/Trombia) -- clear exit path
- 87-90% gross margins at scale with strong recurring revenue
- Bag Cassette consumables create an additional recurring revenue stream
