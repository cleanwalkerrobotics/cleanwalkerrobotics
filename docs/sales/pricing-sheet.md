## ROI Comparison: CleanWalker vs. Manual Collection

### Cost of Manual Litter Collection

| Cost Element | Manual (Per Park/Site) | Source |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Labor (1 FTE litter picker) | $3,200-$4,200/mo | BLS avg $18-24/hr, 40 hrs/wk |
| Benefits & overhead (30-40%) | $960-$1,680/mo | Health, workers comp, payroll tax |
| Equipment & supplies | $100-$200/mo | Grabbers, bags, cart, PPE |
| Supervision allocation | $400-$600/mo | Manager time per crew member |
| **Total manual cost** | **$4,660-$6,680/mo** | **Per worker** |

Most parks require 2-3 litter collection workers to maintain cleanliness across shifts and days.

**Two-worker scenario: $9,320-$13,360/mo per site.**

### CleanWalker Comparison

| Metric | Manual (2 workers) | CleanWalker (2 robots) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Monthly cost | $9,320-$13,360 | $7,000 (Standard) |
| Daily coverage hours | 16 hrs (2x 8-hr shifts) | 20+ hrs (autonomous, self-charging) |
| Weather/night operation | Limited | Full capability |
| Data & reporting | None | Real-time dashboard |
| Scalability | Linear (more people) | Incremental (add robots) |
| **Annual savings** | -- | **$52,000-$100,000/site** |

### Payback Summary

| Scenario | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Replace 2 manual workers with 2 robots (Standard) | $2,320-$6,360 | $27,840-$76,320 |
| Replace 2 manual workers with 2 robots (Fleet) | $3,320-$7,360 | $39,840-$88,320 |
| Supplement 1 worker with 1 robot (Pilot) | $1,860-$3,880 | $22,320-$46,560 |

**Typical ROI: 25-48% cost reduction vs. equivalent manual coverage.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many robots do I need?**
One robot covers approximately 5-10 acres of parkland or campus per day, depending on terrain and litter density. We recommend starting with a pilot to determine optimal coverage for your site.

**What happens if a robot breaks down?**
All plans include replacement coverage. If a robot requires repair beyond field service, we deploy a replacement within 48 hours (24 hours for Fleet customers).

**Can the robots operate in rain?**
Yes. CleanWalker robots are weatherproof (IP54+) and operate in light to moderate rain. They automatically dock during severe weather events.

**What types of litter can it pick up?**
Bottles, cans, wrappers, cups, cigarette butts, paper, and most common litter items from 5g to 500g. The AI detection system is continuously trained on new litter types.

**Is there a setup fee?**
No. All onboarding, site assessment, and deployment costs are included in your monthly rate.

**What about liability?**
CleanWalker carries comprehensive commercial liability insurance. Robots are equipped with multiple safety systems including emergency stop, obstacle avoidance, and pedestrian detection.
