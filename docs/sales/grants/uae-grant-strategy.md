# UAE Grant & Funding Strategy — CleanWalker Robotics

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Entity:** MB Software Studio LLC (US LLC, Dutch founder, NL-based operations)
**Stage:** Pre-revenue, digital prototype (ML model, simulation, CAD, URDF)
**Target Markets:** BEEAH (Sharjah), Emaar (Dubai)
**Funding Need:** ~$363K to reach pilot stage

---

## Executive Summary

The UAE offers a rich ecosystem of accelerators, government-backed funding, and innovation programs that align strongly with CleanWalker's robotics + sustainability positioning. Unlike the Netherlands (where grants dominate), the UAE model centers on **accelerator programs with government partnerships, corporate pilot budgets, and ecosystem incentives** rather than direct R&D grants.

**Key finding:** The Sharjah ecosystem (SRTIP/SAIA + Sheraa + BEEAH proximity) offers the most strategically aligned pathway for CleanWalker, with waste management explicitly listed as a focus area. Abu Dhabi (Hub71 + ADIO) offers the largest funding amounts. Dubai (DFA + MBRIF) provides the highest-profile government partnerships.

## 9. Entity Requirements — UAE Presence

### Do We Need a UAE Entity?

| Program | UAE Entity Required? | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| SRTIP SAIA | Not to apply; SRTIP entity for full benefits | Can join program then establish |
| Hub71+ ClimateTech | Yes (ADGM entity) | Hub71 helps with setup |
| MBRIF Accelerator | No (to apply); yes (before program ends) | Can apply from abroad |
| Sheraa | Yes (Sharjah entity) | Free first-year license provided |
| DFA | No | Visa and accommodation provided |
| ADIO | Yes (Abu Dhabi entity) | Required for grant disbursement |
| Catalyst | Yes (Masdar City FZ) | Workspace included |

### Entity Options — Cost Comparison

| Free Zone | Location | Annual Cost | Key Benefits |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **ADGM Tech Startup** | Abu Dhabi | USD 1,500 + $300 data protection | Hub71 ecosystem, SAFE-friendly jurisdiction, 3-year incentivized rate |
| **Sharjah (via Sheraa)** | Sharjah | Free first year (via Sheraa program) | BEEAH proximity, lowest cost entry |
| **SRTIP** | Sharjah | AED 5,700+ (~$1,550+) | Prototyping facilities, BEEAH proximity |
| **Ajman NuVenture** | Ajman | AED 4,888 (~$1,330) | Cheapest free zone in UAE |
| **IFZA/Meydan** | Dubai | AED 12,500–12,900 (~$3,400–$3,500) | Dubai brand, flexible activities |
| **DSO (Dtec)** | Dubai | AED 10,000+ (~$2,700+) | Tech campus, community |
| **Masdar City FZ** | Abu Dhabi | AED 10,000+ (~$2,700+) | Cleantech brand, R&D access |

### Visa Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Investor/Partner visa | AED 3,800–6,500 |
| Employee visa | AED 3,000–5,000 per employee |
| Golden Visa (entrepreneur) | AED 500K+ project value or incubator endorsement |

### Can We Partner with BEEAH Instead?

**Yes, partially.** A direct partnership/pilot with BEEAH does not require a UAE entity — an international company can sign a service agreement or MoU. However:

- To receive UAE government funding (ADIO, Hub71), a UAE entity is required
- To establish long-term commercial operations, a free zone entity is necessary
- A UAE entity provides credibility with all other UAE stakeholders

**Recommendation:** Use the **Sheraa free business license** (free first year) as the cheapest initial UAE entity. If pursuing Hub71/ADIO, set up an ADGM Tech Startup License (USD 1,800/year total).

## 11. Cumulative Funding Potential

### Best-Case Scenario (All Programs Secured)

| Program | Amount | Type | Timeline |
|---------|--------|------|----------|
| Hub71+ ClimateTech | AED 750,000 (~$204K) | Cash + in-kind (SAFE note) | 2026 |
| ADIO Innovation | AED 367,500–1,100,000 (~$100K–$300K) | Milestone-based grant | 2026–2027 |
| SRTIP SAIA | ~AED 50,000 (~$14K) | In-kind (prototyping, workspace) | 2026 |
| MBRIF Guarantee Scheme | AED 500,000–2,000,000 (~$136K–$545K) | Government-backed loan | 2027 |
| Sheraa | AED 3,035,000 (~$9.5K cash + support) | Equity-free grant + support | 2026 |
| Seal the Deal investor matching | AED 500,000–1,000,000 (~$136K–$272K) | Angel investment | 2026–2027 |
| ADNOC/Tabreed/TAQA pilot budgets | AED 500,000–2,500,000 (~$136K–$681K) | Corporate pilot | 2027 |
| **Subtotal UAE funding** | **~AED 2.7M–7.4M ($735K–$2.0M)** | | |

### Realistic Scenario

| Program | Amount | Probability |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Hub71+ ClimateTech (cash) | AED 250,000 (~$68K) | 25% (deadline may have passed) |
| SRTIP SAIA | AED 50,000 in-kind | 60% (waste mgmt is explicit focus) |
| MBRIF Accelerator (strategic value) | AED 0 (non-cash) | 50% |
| Sheraa grant | AED 35,000 (~$9.5K) | 30% (needs traction) |
| ADIO | AED 367,500 (~$100K) | 20% (needs prototype + AD entity) |
| Seal the Deal investment | AED 500,000 (~$136K) | 25% |
| **Expected value** | **~AED 160,000–200,000 (~$44K–$55K)** | |

The realistic expected value from UAE programs alone is modest, but the **strategic value** — BEEAH introductions, government partnerships, pilot opportunities — far exceeds the direct funding. UAE programs should be pursued primarily for **market access and partnerships**, with Netherlands programs (WBSO, VFF) providing the core R&D funding.

---

## 12. UAE vs Netherlands — Combined Strategy

| Dimension | Netherlands | UAE | Combined Approach |
|-----------|------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Primary value** | R&D tax credits and grants | Market access and partnerships | R&D in NL, deploy in UAE |
| **Funding type** | Direct grants/tax credits | Accelerators + milestone grants | NL funds development; UAE funds deployment |
| **Top program** | WBSO (€48K/year) | Hub71 (AED 500K+) | Both, simultaneously |
| **Entity** | BV (recommended) | Free zone company | Dutch BV + Sharjah/ADGM entity |
| **Stage fit** | Now (pre-revenue) | Now (accelerators) + H2 2026 (grants) | Start both tracks in parallel |
| **Timeline** | WBSO now; MIT Apr 2026 | SAIA Feb 2026; MBRIF Q2 2026 | Overlapping applications |

**Recommended dual-track approach:**
1. Apply for WBSO + MIT in Netherlands (fund R&D)
2. Apply for SRTIP SAIA + MBRIF in UAE (gain market access)
3. Use NL prototype development to qualify for UAE pilot programs
4. Use UAE government partnerships to attract NL investors (VFF matching)
