### Amsterdam's Litter Challenge

Amsterdam welcomes over 20 million visitors annually. Its 30+ major parks, 100km of canal-side paths, and historic cobblestone streets generate litter volumes that manual collection struggles to address consistently. The Schoon en Afvalvrij (Clean & Waste Free) Framework 2025-2028 recognizes this — setting ambitious cleanliness targets that demand new approaches beyond traditional methods.

Manual litter picking is slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult to staff. Meanwhile, Amsterdam's parks, playgrounds, and canal paths need continuous attention — not just scheduled rounds.

### Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. Using AI-powered vision trained on 25,000+ litter images, it detects and collects items from cigarette butts to bottles autonomously. Unlike wheeled machines, its four-legged design navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, curbs, and park paths — terrain that defines Amsterdam's public spaces.

**Key capabilities:**
- 95% litter detection accuracy across 20+ object categories
- 4+ hours continuous operation per charge
- IP65 weatherproof — operates in Dutch rain conditions
- Under 55 dB — quieter than a conversation, suitable for residential areas
- Collected waste bagged for existing collection routes — no new infrastructure

### Proposed Pilot: 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Vondelpark, Westerpark, and canal-side paths (Prinsengracht/Herengracht belt)

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Site mapping, dock installation, fleet calibration
- Month 3-8: Full autonomous operation across all three zones

**KPIs we commit to measuring:**
- Litter items collected per day per unit
- Coverage area per shift (target: 2,000-4,000 m2/hr per unit)
- System uptime (target: >90%)
- Public interaction incidents (target: zero)
- Cleanliness score improvement in pilot zones

### Why Now

The Schoon & Afvalvrij Framework is entering its implementation phase. Amsterdam has the budget, the mandate, and the political will to pilot innovative cleaning technology. CleanWalker is pilot-ready and seeking one European city as our flagship deployment.

No commercial quadrupedal litter robot exists anywhere in the world. Amsterdam would be the first city to deploy one — a global story that aligns with the city's reputation for innovation and sustainability leadership.

As a Dutch founder, I understand the city's culture and operations firsthand. We can work in Dutch or English.
