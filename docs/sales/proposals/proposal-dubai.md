### The Opportunity

BEEAH has pioneered smart city waste management in the MENA region — from the AI City Vision system on collection vehicles to the world's first fully AI-driven headquarters. BEEAH Tandeef operates city-scale cleaning across Sharjah and beyond.

Yet street-level litter collection remains manual. Across the UAE, thousands of workers perform litter picking in extreme heat, covering parks, waterfronts, and public plazas on foot. This is the last major cleaning operation untouched by automation — and it is exactly what CleanWalker was built to solve.

### Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. AI vision detects litter across 20+ categories (cigarette butts, bottles, wrappers, food waste). Four-legged locomotion handles sand, grass, paved plazas, and uneven terrain. Collected waste is bagged for existing collection routes.

**Key capabilities:**
- Autonomous operation 20+ hours/day (multi-shift with dock charging)
- Operates in temperatures up to 45 degrees C — built for Gulf conditions
- 95% detection accuracy, trained on 25,000+ real-world litter images
- Under 55 dB — suitable for residential and tourist areas
- Fleet management dashboard with real-time monitoring and remote override

### Proposed Pilot: 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Al Majaz Waterfront, Al Qasba Canal, and Sharjah Corniche

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Site survey, dock installation, AI City Vision integration scoping
- Month 3-8: Full autonomous operation with BEEAH Tandeef coordination

**KPIs we commit to measuring:**
- Litter items collected per unit per day
- Coverage area per shift (target: 2,000-4,000 m2/hr per unit)
- System uptime in Gulf heat conditions (target: >90%)
- Integration touchpoints with existing BEEAH collection routes
- Public engagement metrics (social media, media coverage)

### Why Now

BEEAH is expanding its smart city footprint across the UAE and into Egypt and KSA. Adding autonomous quadrupedal litter collection to the BEEAH technology portfolio creates a new capability that no competitor offers — globally.

A Sharjah pilot would be the first deployment of a commercial quadrupedal litter robot in the Middle East. Combined with BEEAH's existing AI City Vision platform, it positions BEEAH at the forefront of fully autonomous urban cleaning.

The regional visibility — a walking robot cleaning Sharjah's waterfront — generates immediate international media attention and strengthens BEEAH's innovation brand ahead of GITEX and future smart city showcases.
