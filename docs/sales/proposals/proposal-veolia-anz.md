### You Already Proved This Works

Veolia's "Scoop Doggy Dog" quadruped trial at Bondi Beach demonstrated that robotic litter collection on complex terrain is viable. Camera-based detection, four-legged locomotion on sand, and autonomous pickup of bottles and cans — the concept was validated.

CleanWalker is the commercial product that makes it scalable.

### The Problem at Scale

Sydney's beaches and coastal paths attract millions of visitors annually. The City of Sydney alone allocates AUD 86 million per year to cleansing and resource recovery, with AUD 2.7 billion earmarked over the next decade for open space and infrastructure. Across Veolia's ANZ contract portfolio, manual litter collection on beaches, parks, and coastal paths remains labour-intensive, difficult to staff, and inconsistent in coverage.

### Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot. Built on the same concept Veolia trialed at Bondi — but engineered for continuous commercial operation.

**Key capabilities:**
- AI detection across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ images
- All-terrain locomotion: sand, grass, gravel, paths, stairs, curbs
- 4+ hours continuous operation per charge, multi-shift capability
- IP65 weatherproof — handles coastal salt spray and rain
- Bag cassette system integrates with existing Veolia collection routes
- Fleet management dashboard for real-time monitoring at scale

**What's different from the Bondi trial:**
- Production-grade hardware with 2,000+ hour MTBF
- 15-20L collection capacity (vs. 14kg bucket prototype)
- Full fleet management software for multi-unit coordination
- Designed for EU Machinery Regulation and UL 3300 compliance

### Proposed Pilot: 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Bondi-to-Coogee coastal walk, Centennial Parklands, and one additional Veolia-managed site of your choice

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Site mapping, dock installation, Veolia operations integration
- Month 3-8: Full autonomous operation coordinated with Veolia collection schedules

**KPIs we commit to measuring:**
- Litter items collected per unit per day
- Coverage area per shift (target: 2,000-4,000 m2/hr per unit)
- System uptime (target: >90%)
- Labour hour offset vs. manual collection baseline
- Beach cleanliness scores pre/post deployment

### Why Now

Veolia has already invested in proving this concept. CleanWalker turns that investment into a commercial reality. A successful 10-unit pilot in Sydney creates the blueprint for deployment across Veolia's 56-country portfolio — parks, beaches, campuses, and urban spaces worldwide.

No other company offers a commercial quadrupedal litter robot. This is a first-mover window for Veolia to own autonomous litter collection globally before competitors catch up.
