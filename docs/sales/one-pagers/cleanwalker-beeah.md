**Autonomous Litter Collection — The Next Step for AI City Vision**

---

## The Challenge

BEEAH has set the benchmark for smart waste management in the MENA region — from the AI City Vision system on collection vehicles to the world's first fully AI-driven headquarters. BEEAH Tandeef operates city-scale cleaning across Sharjah and beyond. Yet street-level litter collection remains the last major cleaning operation untouched by automation. Across the UAE, thousands of workers perform litter picking on foot in extreme heat — covering parks, waterfronts, and public plazas manually. This gap is exactly what CleanWalker was built to close.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, purpose-built for Gulf conditions:

- **AI vision trained on 25,000+ litter images** — detects 20+ categories autonomously, from cigarette butts to food waste, across sand, paved plazas, and grass
- **Operates in temperatures up to 45°C** — engineered for sustained Gulf heat with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging)
- **Quadrupedal locomotion** navigates uneven terrain, curbs, and mixed surfaces that wheeled machines cannot handle — ideal for waterfronts and public parks
- **Fleet management dashboard** with real-time monitoring, remote override, and integration potential with BEEAH's AI City Vision platform

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Al Majaz Waterfront, Al Qasba Canal, and Sharjah Corniche.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in Gulf conditions | >90% |
| Integration with BEEAH collection routes | Coordinated handoff to Tandeef teams |
| Public engagement & media coverage | Measured across social + press |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | Custom — based on deployment scope, fleet size, and SLA requirements |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across managed sites |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — BEEAH pays only for the service |

A Sharjah pilot positions BEEAH as the first operator of a commercial quadrupedal litter robot in the Middle East — a global first with immediate media impact ahead of GITEX and smart city showcases.
