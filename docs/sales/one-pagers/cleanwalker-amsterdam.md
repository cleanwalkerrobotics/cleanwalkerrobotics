**Autonome Afvalverzameling — Partner voor Schoon en Afvalvrij 2025–2028**

## The Challenge

Amsterdam welcomes over 20 million visitors annually. Its 30+ major parks, 100 km of canal-side paths, and historic cobblestone streets generate litter volumes that manual collection cannot address consistently. The Schoon en Afvalvrij (Clean & Waste Free) Framework 2025–2028 sets ambitious cleanliness targets — yet traditional methods are slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult to staff. Parks, playgrounds, and canal paths need continuous attention, not just scheduled rounds.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, built for exactly the terrain that defines Amsterdam:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, wrappers, and more, identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, curbs, and park paths — terrain where wheeled machines fail
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — quieter than a conversation, suitable for residential neighbourhoods, Vondelpark, and canal-side paths at any hour
- **IP65 weatherproof** — designed to operate reliably in Dutch rain conditions, year-round

Collected waste is bagged for existing collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Vondelpark, Westerpark, and Prinsengracht/Herengracht canal-side belt.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime | >90% |
| Public interaction incidents | Zero |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | Custom — based on deployment scope, fleet size, and SLA requirements |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across park zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the municipality pays only for the service |

No commercial quadrupedal litter robot exists anywhere in the world. Amsterdam would be the first European city to deploy one — aligning with the Schoon & Afvalvrij ambition and the city's global reputation for innovation.

## Next Steps

We'd welcome a **20-minute call** to discuss fit, timeline, and pilot scope. As a Dutch founder, I'm happy to work in Dutch or English.
