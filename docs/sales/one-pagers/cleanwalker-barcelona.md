**Autonomous Litter Collection — Robotics for Cuidem Barcelona**

---

## The Challenge

Barcelona spends EUR 300 million per year on public space cleaning through the Cuidem Barcelona contract — 10% of the entire city budget. With 30 million+ tourists annually, La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, Barceloneta beach, and 68 city parks face relentless litter pressure. The Cuidem contract itself references service robots and AI as future capabilities. BIT's budget has nearly doubled to EUR 113 million, and the EUR 435 million Pla Endreça (2025–2027) represents the largest-ever investment in public space maintenance. Meanwhile, Valencia already piloted an autonomous street cleaner in May 2025. Barcelona has the budget, the mandate, and now the competitive pressure to act.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, engineered for Mediterranean urban conditions:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, cans, wrappers, identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, sand, stairs, and ramp transitions — surfaces where wheeled robots cannot reach
- **Mediterranean heat tolerance** — designed for sustained summer operation in 35°C+ conditions
- **Sentilo/CityOS integration potential** — fleet telemetry and litter heatmap data can feed into Barcelona's existing 18,000+ sensor IoT platform
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential neighbourhoods and La Rambla at any hour

Collected waste is bagged for existing collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Parc de la Ciutadella, Barceloneta beach promenade, and Gràcia district pedestrian zone.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime | >90% |
| Public interaction incidents | Zero |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across managed zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the city pays only for the service |

A Barcelona pilot starting in Q2 2026 produces results ready to showcase at Smart City Expo World Congress (November 3–5, 2026) — at Barcelona's own event, on Barcelona's own stage. With 850+ city delegations attending, a live CleanWalker deployment becomes the strongest possible reference for international municipal sales.

## Next Steps

We'd welcome a **20-minute call** to discuss fit with Cuidem Barcelona innovation goals, BIT Habitat challenge participation, and deployment timeline.
