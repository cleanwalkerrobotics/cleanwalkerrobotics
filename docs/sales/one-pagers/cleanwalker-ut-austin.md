**Autonomous Litter Collection — Campus-Ready Robots, Research-Grade Data**

---

## The Challenge

UT Austin manages 431 acres, 20+ million square feet of built space, and 51,000+ students — with a 700-person Facilities Services team led by Darren Hale keeping it all running. The university has already proven that autonomous robots can operate safely on campus through the $3.6 million NSF "Living and Working with Robots" grant, deploying Boston Dynamics Spot and Unitree Go1 across campus with regulatory and insurance barriers pre-cleared. Meanwhile, the Custodial Services team under Ben Triplett covers millions of square feet at APPA cleanliness standards. But outdoor litter collection across the Forty Acres — walkways, green spaces, plazas, and event areas — remains entirely manual. With the UT Works modernisation underway, new buildings coming online (Engineering Discovery Building 2026, QLab), and Austin's position as a robotics and AI hub, the infrastructure and institutional appetite for campus robotics are already in place.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot — purpose-built for the type of campus environment UT Austin has already proven robot-ready:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, food wrappers, and cups identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, brick paths, stairs, and curb transitions — exactly the mixed terrain across UT's campus that wheeled machines cannot handle
- **Texas heat operation** — engineered for sustained high-temperature performance with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging), maintaining coverage through Austin's extended summers
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for operation near classrooms, libraries, and residential halls during any hour
- **Research-grade data** — litter heatmaps, waste composition analytics, and movement logs available for UT research groups, with potential co-publication on campus-scale autonomous litter collection

Collected waste is bagged for existing Facilities Services collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 4 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** South Mall / Main Mall corridor, Speedway pedestrian zone, and East Campus green spaces.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in Texas heat | >90% |
| Terrain types navigated | Grass, gravel, brick, paved, stairs, curbs |
| APPA cleanliness level impact | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across campus zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — UT pays only for the service |

UT Austin is uniquely positioned for this pilot. The NSF grant has already cleared the regulatory and insurance path for autonomous robots on campus. Prof. Luis Sentis and Prof. Justin Hart's research groups provide a natural co-publication opportunity — the first peer-reviewed study of commercial quadrupedal litter collection in a university environment. The UT-City of Austin Innovation Partnership (November 2025) means a successful campus pilot directly informs city-wide deployment discussions. And with Austin as CleanWalker's target US pilot city, the relationship extends well beyond a single contract.
