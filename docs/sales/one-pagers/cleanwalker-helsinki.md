**Autonomous Litter Collection — The Next Chapter After Trombia**

---

## The Challenge

Helsinki proved that autonomous cleaning robots work in real urban conditions when Trombia's electric sweeper was piloted in Jätkäsaari in 2021 — a collaboration between Forum Virium Helsinki and Stara that launched Trombia into international markets. But sweeping is only half the problem. Individual litter items — cigarette butts, bottles, wrappers, food containers — scattered across parks, waterfront promenades, and pedestrian zones still require manual collection by Stara's 1,200+ workforce. As Helsinki pursues Carbon-neutral 2035, the last major outdoor maintenance task untouched by automation is street-level litter picking.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot — built to complement sweepers like Trombia, not replace them:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — detects and collects cigarette butts, bottles, wrappers, and food waste autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, curbs, and mixed-terrain park paths — exactly the surfaces where Trombia and wheeled machines cannot operate
- **Nordic-weather operation** — IP65 weatherproof, designed for year-round Helsinki conditions including rain, snow, and sub-zero temperatures
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential areas, Esplanadi, and waterfront paths at any hour
- **Data integration** — litter heatmaps and waste composition data for Stara operations planning

Collected waste is bagged for existing Stara collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 4 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Jätkäsaari / Hietaranta (Trombia's pilot area), Esplanadi / Kaivopuisto, and Kalasatama.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in Nordic conditions | >90% |
| Terrain types navigated | Grass, gravel, cobblestone, paved, curbs |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | Custom — based on deployment scope, fleet size, and SLA requirements |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across park zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the city pays only for the service |

Forum Virium helped Trombia go from Helsinki pilot to global markets. CleanWalker is ready for the same journey — starting where Trombia left off, addressing the complementary problem of individual litter collection on complex terrain. Finland's permissive robot regulations and Helsinki's smart city brand make this the ideal European launchpad.
