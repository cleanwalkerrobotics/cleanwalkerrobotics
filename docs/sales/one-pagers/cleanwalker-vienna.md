**Autonomous Litter Collection — First-Mover for Vienna's Fleet Electrification**

---

## The Challenge

MA48 swept 10,291 tons of waste from Vienna's streets in 2023 and has committed EUR 56 million to replacing all 1,245 utility vehicles with electric alternatives — no new diesel from 2025. The Smart Klima City Strategy targets climate neutrality by 2040 across 74 measures. Yet autonomous street-level litter collection remains untested in Vienna. No pilot has been conducted. With ICRA 2026 coming to Vienna on June 1–5 — the world's premier robotics conference, themed "Robots for all" — the timing for a first-mover deployment is exceptional.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, purpose-built for complex European urban terrain:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, cans, wrappers, identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, curbs, and park paths — Vienna's Ring, Prater, and Danube Island paths are ideal terrain
- **Fully electric, zero-emission** — aligns directly with MA48's fleet electrification and the Smart Klima City 2040 strategy
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential Bezirke, parks, and pedestrian zones at any hour
- **IP65 weatherproof** — designed for year-round Central European conditions

Collected waste is bagged for existing MA48 collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Prater Hauptallee, Donauinsel (Danube Island), and Stadtpark / Ringstraße green belt.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime | >90% |
| Public interaction incidents | Zero |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | Custom — based on deployment scope, fleet size, and SLA requirements |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across managed zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the city pays only for the service |

Vienna would be the first major European capital to deploy a commercial quadrupedal litter robot — a global first with immediate media impact. An operational pilot during ICRA 2026 (7,000+ attendees, June 1–5) means the world's robotics research community sees CleanWalker working in a real city, on real terrain. No better stage exists. Through Urban Innovation Vienna's international partnerships network, a Vienna reference carries weight across the EU.

## Next Steps

We'd welcome a **20-minute call** to discuss alignment with MA48's electrification programme, ICRA 2026 timing, and pilot scope.
