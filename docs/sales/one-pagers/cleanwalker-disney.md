**Autonomous Litter Collection — The Little Robot That Keeps the Magic Clean**

---

## The Challenge

Walt Disney World welcomes 58 million+ visitors annually across four theme parks, two water parks, and 25+ resort hotels — generating continuous litter across pathways, plazas, queue areas, and resort grounds. Disney's zero-waste-to-landfill by 2030 goal requires closing a 32-percentage-point gap (from 58% to 90% diversion), and every piece of litter collected before it reaches a bin is data that informs source reduction. The AVAC pneumatic waste system covers Magic Kingdom and part of EPCOT, but Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Disney Springs, and all resort grounds have no automated outdoor collection. With $60 billion committed in capital investment over the next decade — roughly $18 billion allocated to technology and maintenance — and BDX droids set to debut in 2026 through the Disney-NVIDIA-DeepMind partnership, Disney is already investing in free-roaming autonomous robots. The missing piece is a robot that works, not performs — one that keeps outdoor spaces clean around the clock.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot — engineered for large-scale outdoor environments where guest experience is paramount:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, food wrappers, popcorn boxes, and cups identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, mulch, paved walkways, and curb transitions — exactly the mixed terrain across resort grounds, parking areas, and between-attraction pathways
- **Florida climate tolerance** — operates in heat, humidity, and rain with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging), maintaining coverage during peak summer and after-hours when manual staffing is thinnest
- **Silent operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for resort grounds, pool areas, and guest pathways without disrupting the experience
- **Waste composition data** — real-time litter analytics by type, location, and time of day, directly supporting the 2030 zero-waste goal with actionable source-reduction intelligence

Collected waste is sorted and bagged for existing Disney waste collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Disney Springs outdoor areas, one resort hotel grounds (e.g., Coronado Springs), and Animal Kingdom Lodge pathways.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in Florida conditions | >90% |
| Waste diversion contribution | Litter-to-type data for source reduction |
| Guest perception | Survey baseline + post-pilot sentiment |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | Custom — based on deployment scope, fleet size, and SLA requirements |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across resort zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — Disney pays only for the service |

Disney has a unique relationship with robots — guests expect them. A CleanWalker unit quietly collecting litter along resort pathways is not just an operations tool; it is a character. The quadrupedal form factor, purposeful movement, and visible environmental mission create a natural guest interaction moment — "the little robot that keeps Disney clean." With BDX droids proving that free-roaming robots enhance (not disrupt) the guest experience, CleanWalker extends that philosophy from entertainment to environmental stewardship. A successful pilot at Disney becomes the most powerful case study in autonomous cleaning — bar none.
