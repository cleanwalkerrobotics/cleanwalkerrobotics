**Autonomous Litter Collection — From Indoor Robots to Outdoor Autonomy**

---

## The Challenge

Enova by Veolia manages facilities across MENAT for some of the region's most demanding clients — malls, airports, healthcare campuses, and metro systems serving millions of visitors daily. With a 40,000+ workforce and 350,000+ assets under management, Enova has already embraced AI cleaning robots indoors (Emrill's LeoMop deployed at Dubai Festival City Mall). But outdoor spaces — the promenades, parking structures, landscaped plazas, and community pathways surrounding MAF properties — still rely entirely on manual litter collection. In temperatures exceeding 45°C, outdoor litter picking is the most physically demanding and hardest-to-staff cleaning task across the portfolio. As Enova's LEED Platinum commitment and Hubgrade smart monitoring show, the appetite for next-generation facility technology is already there.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot — the outdoor complement to the indoor robots Enova already deploys:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, food wrappers, and plastic bags identified and collected autonomously
- **Gulf heat tolerance** — operates in temperatures up to 45°C with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging), maintaining coverage during peak summer when outdoor manual labour is most constrained
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates landscaped pathways, grass, gravel, sand, and curb transitions — terrain types surrounding malls and communities where wheeled machines leave gaps
- **Silent operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for retail surrounds, hospital campuses, and residential communities without disturbing visitors or residents
- **Fleet dashboard** with real-time monitoring, coverage tracking, and litter composition analytics — designed to integrate with Enova's Hubgrade smart monitoring platform

Collected waste is bagged for existing Enova collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 8 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Mall of the Emirates outdoor promenades, City Centre Deira surrounds, and one MAF residential community.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in Gulf conditions | >90% |
| Integration with Hubgrade monitoring | Real-time fleet data feed |
| Coverage hours vs. manual baseline | 20+ hrs/day autonomous vs. shift-limited manual |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across managed sites |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — Enova pays only for the service |

Enova's Veolia lineage means the CleanWalker partnership carries strategic weight beyond a single deployment. A successful pilot positions Enova as the first Veolia entity globally to operate quadrupedal litter robots — a differentiated capability across the entire Veolia network. Combined with the MAF Launchpad Accelerator's focus on climatetech and proptech, CleanWalker fits naturally into the innovation ecosystem Enova and MAF are building.
