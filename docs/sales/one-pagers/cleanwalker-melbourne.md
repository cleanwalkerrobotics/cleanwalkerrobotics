**Autonomous Litter Collection — Built for the Emerging Technology Testbed**

---

## The Challenge

The City of Melbourne spends AUD 59.8 million annually on street cleaning — running a 24/7 Clean Team, removing 130,000 square metres of graffiti, and maintaining parks, laneways, and public plazas across the CBD and surrounding suburbs. With an 8.4% maintenance budget cut flagged by the Committee for Melbourne, the pressure to do more with less is real. The city already deploys 450 BigBelly smart bins and runs an Emerging Technology Testbed with 26 founding partners including AWS, Telstra, PwC, and CSIRO. The Worms at Work pilot is running right now. The Argyle Square sensor pilot (with AWS, Citywide, and the University of Melbourne) demonstrated appetite for IoT-connected public space technology. Yet individual litter collection — cigarette butts, bottles, wrappers scattered across parks, river walks, and pedestrian zones — remains entirely manual.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot — a natural fit for Melbourne's Emerging Technology Testbed:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — detects and collects cigarette butts, bottles, wrappers, and food waste autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, curb transitions, and mixed-terrain park paths — the surfaces across Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens, Yarra promenade, and Fitzroy Gardens where wheeled machines cannot operate
- **All-weather operation** — IP65 weatherproof for Melbourne's variable conditions, with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging)
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential parkland, laneways, and waterfront paths at any hour
- **Data integration** — litter heatmaps and waste composition analytics designed to integrate with Melbourne's smart city data infrastructure and complement existing BigBelly sensor networks

Collected waste is bagged for existing City of Melbourne collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 4 Units, 90 Days

**Deployment zones:** Royal Botanic Gardens paths, Yarra River promenade (Southbank to Docklands), and Fitzroy Gardens.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in variable conditions | >90% |
| Terrain types navigated | Grass, gravel, cobblestone, paved, curbs |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across park zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the city pays only for the service |

Melbourne's Testbed is designed exactly for this — evaluating emerging technologies in controlled real-world deployments before broader rollout. CleanWalker fits the testbed model: defined pilot zone, measurable KPIs, short evaluation period, and clear path to city-wide scale. With the 8.4% maintenance budget cut creating pressure to deliver cleanliness outcomes more efficiently, autonomous litter collection is not a future ambition — it is an immediate operational need.
