**Autonomous Litter Collection — Premium Outdoor Spaces, Maintained Autonomously**

---

## The Challenge

Emaar manages some of the world's most prestigious outdoor spaces — Downtown Dubai around Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall surrounds, Dubai Marina, and Arabian Ranches communities spanning 50,000+ homes across 10+ master-planned developments. With 141 million sq ft of new land acquired in 2024 and AED 35.5 billion in revenue (+33% YoY), the portfolio is scaling fast. Yet outdoor litter collection in these premium environments still relies on manual labour — expensive, inconsistent, and difficult to staff at the quality Emaar's brand demands. After winning "Sustainable FM Organization of the Year" (MENA Green Building Awards, November 2024), Emaar is positioned to lead on the next generation of sustainable facilities management.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, engineered for Gulf premium property environments:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, food wrappers, and plastic bags identified and collected autonomously
- **Gulf heat tolerance** — operates in temperatures up to 45°C with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging), maintaining consistent coverage during peak summer when manual workers cannot
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates landscaped pathways, grass, gravel, sand, pool deck surrounds, and curb transitions — premium terrain where wheeled machines leave gaps
- **Silent operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential communities, hotel surrounds, and retail promenades without disturbing residents or guests
- **Fleet dashboard** with real-time monitoring, coverage tracking, and litter composition analytics for ECM operations teams

Collected waste is bagged for existing facilities collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Downtown Dubai Boulevard, Dubai Marina Walk, and one Arabian Ranches community.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in Gulf conditions | >90% |
| Resident/guest satisfaction | Survey baseline + post-pilot |
| Coverage hours vs. manual baseline | 20+ hrs/day autonomous vs. shift-limited manual |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across communities |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — Emaar pays only for the service |

A CleanWalker robot patrolling the Burj Khalifa boulevard is not just a cleaning solution — it is a global brand statement. Emaar's Innovation Challenge shows appetite for pioneering technologies. Deploying the world's first quadrupedal litter robot across Downtown Dubai would generate immediate international media coverage and position Emaar as the global leader in autonomous premium property maintenance — well ahead of any competitor in the Gulf or worldwide.
