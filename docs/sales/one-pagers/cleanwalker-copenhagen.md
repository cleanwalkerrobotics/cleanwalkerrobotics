**Autonomous Litter Collection — A Smart City Solution for the Green Capital**

---

## The Challenge

Copenhagen's green capital ambition sets some of Europe's highest standards for public space quality. With the Resource & Waste Strategy 2030 and Climate Plan 2035 creating fresh mandates and budget cycles, the city is actively seeking data-driven digital solutions for waste management. Copenhagen Solutions Lab has already deployed 600+ Nordsense IoT waste bin sensors — optimising when bins are emptied. But the litter that never reaches a bin? That still relies on ~200 street cleaners covering 374 km of roads and hundreds of hectares of parks manually. The IoT sensors tell you when a bin is full. CleanWalker collects what never made it to the bin.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, purpose-built for Nordic urban conditions:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, cans, wrappers, identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, cobblestones, cycle paths, and park terrain — surfaces where wheeled robots fail
- **Cold-weather operation** — engineered for year-round Nordic conditions including rain, wind, and low temperatures
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential neighbourhoods and parks at any hour
- **Nordsense-complementary** — litter heatmap data from CleanWalker can feed into existing waste analytics alongside IoT bin data

Collected waste is bagged for existing collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Fælledparken, Islands Brygge waterfront, and Nørrebro Superkilen.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime | >90% |
| Public interaction incidents | Zero |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across park zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the city pays only for the service |

Copenhagen would be the first Nordic city to deploy a commercial quadrupedal litter robot — complementing the Nordsense IoT network and strengthening Copenhagen's position as Europe's leading smart city. Through the Nordic Smart City Network, a successful pilot becomes a reference for Helsinki, Oslo, Stockholm, and beyond.

## Next Steps

We'd welcome a **20-minute call** to discuss fit with the Resource & Waste Strategy 2030, Solutions Lab pilot process, and deployment scope.
