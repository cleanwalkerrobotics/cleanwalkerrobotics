**Autonomous Litter Collection — From Bondi Trial to Commercial Scale**

---

## The Challenge

Veolia's "Scoop Doggy Dog" trial at Bondi Beach proved that quadrupedal robotic litter collection works on complex coastal terrain. But the prototype was just that — a prototype. Meanwhile, manual litter collection across your ANZ contract portfolio remains labour-intensive, difficult to staff, and inconsistent in coverage. The City of Sydney alone allocates AUD 86 million per year to cleansing, with AUD 2.7 billion earmarked for open space over the next decade. The concept is validated — what's missing is the commercial product.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the production-grade system that makes your Bondi vision scalable:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — from cigarette butts to bottles, on sand, grass, and paved paths
- **All-terrain quadrupedal locomotion** — handles beaches, coastal walks, stairs, curbs, and parkland that wheeled machines cannot reach
- **Production-grade reliability** — 2,000+ hour MTBF, IP65 weatherproof (salt spray and rain rated), 15–20L collection capacity with bag cassette system
- **Fleet management dashboard** for real-time monitoring, multi-unit coordination, and integration with existing Veolia collection schedules

## Pilot Proposal — 10 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Bondi-to-Coogee coastal walk, Centennial Parklands, and one additional Veolia-managed site of your choice.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime | >90% |
| Labour hour offset vs. manual baseline | Measured against current staffing |
| Beach cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post deployment comparison |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | USD 3,000–3,500 (RaaS model, all-inclusive) |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across fleet deployment |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — Veolia pays only for the service |

A successful Sydney pilot creates the blueprint for deployment across Veolia's 56-country portfolio.
