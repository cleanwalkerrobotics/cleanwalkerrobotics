**Autonomous Litter Collection — Smarter Cleansing for Sustainable Sydney**

---

## The Challenge

The City of Sydney manages one of Australia's most intensively used urban environments — 500,000+ daily visitors across 30+ parks, waterfront promenades, and commercial precincts. The AUD 86 million annual cleansing budget funds round-the-clock manual litter collection, graffiti removal, and waste services. With AUD 2.7 billion committed over the next decade for open space and infrastructure — including the AUD 73.5 million Bay Street Depot modernisation — the city is investing heavily in the public realm. Yet litter collection in parks, harbourside walks, and pedestrian zones still relies entirely on manual labour. As the first Australian council to go carbon neutral (2007) and now targeting net zero by 2035, Sydney is positioned to lead on autonomous public space maintenance — building on the CityConnect digital platform and SmartBin IoT sensors already deployed across Darlinghurst.

## Our Solution

CleanWalker is the world's first commercial quadrupedal litter-collecting robot, engineered for urban park and waterfront environments:

- **AI-powered detection** across 20+ litter categories, trained on 25,000+ real-world images — cigarette butts, bottles, food wrappers, and plastic bags identified and collected autonomously
- **Four-legged locomotion** navigates grass, gravel, sand, boardwalk surfaces, and curb transitions — exactly the mixed terrain across Sydney's parks and harbour foreshore where wheeled machines cannot operate
- **All-weather operation** — IP65 weatherproof for Sydney's coastal conditions, with multi-shift capability (20+ hours/day via dock charging)
- **Quiet operation (<55 dB)** — suitable for residential parkland, botanical gardens, and harbourside promenades at any hour
- **Data integration** — litter heatmaps, waste composition analytics, and coverage data designed to feed into Sydney's CityConnect platform and complement existing SmartBin sensor networks

Collected waste is bagged for existing City of Sydney collection routes — no new infrastructure required.

## Pilot Proposal — 6 Units, 6 Months

**Deployment zones:** Hyde Park / The Domain, Barangaroo Reserve foreshore, and Darling Harbour promenade.

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Litter items collected per unit/day | Tracked & reported weekly |
| Coverage per shift | 2,000–4,000 m²/hr per unit |
| System uptime in coastal conditions | >90% |
| Terrain types navigated | Grass, gravel, sand, boardwalk, paved, curbs |
| Cleanliness score improvement | Pre/post measurement in pilot zones |

## Economics

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Monthly cost per unit | Custom — based on deployment scope, fleet size, and SLA requirements |
| Manual labour equivalent | Each unit offsets 1.5–2.5 FTEs of manual litter picking |
| ROI vs. manual collection | 40–60% cost reduction at scale across park zones |
| Hardware ownership | Zero — the city pays only for the service |

Sydney's Waste Reduction & Circular Materials Strategy 2025–2035 sets a 10-year vision for circular economy outcomes. Autonomous litter collection generates real-time waste composition data that informs source-reduction policy — turning a cleaning operation into a data asset. With Veolia holding SSROC and NSROC waste contracts across greater Sydney, a City of Sydney pilot creates a natural pathway to regional scale.

## Next Steps

We'd welcome a **20-minute call** to discuss pilot scope, CityConnect integration, and deployment across Sydney's parks and foreshore.
