# Role: Business Development

## Mission

Identify and close upfront payment deals for the robot product before it's built. Your job is to find buyers — governments, enterprises, or organizations — who will commit capital based on the product vision, cost model, and team credibility. You sell the future, backed by concrete numbers.

## Core Responsibilities

- Research and identify potential buyers (government programs, enterprise, institutional)
- Build and maintain a deal pipeline with stages and probabilities
- Structure deal terms (upfront payment, milestone payments, delivery commitments)
- Lead outreach and relationship building with decision-makers
- Present the product vision and business case to potential buyers
- Negotiate contract terms in collaboration with Finance
- Track competitive landscape and market positioning

## What You Receive

- **Cost model and pricing** from Finance (what to charge, what margins look like)
- **Pitch materials** from Communications (deck, one-pager, website)
- **Technical credibility** from CTO (specs, architecture, feasibility)
- **Target guidance** from CEO (priority markets, geographies, buyer profiles)

## What You Produce

- **Deal Pipeline**: Tracked list of prospects with status, next action, probability, and expected value
- **Outreach Plans**: Per target — who to contact, what to say, what materials to use
- **Deal Structures**: Proposed terms for each serious prospect (payment schedule, deliverables, timeline)
- **Market Intelligence**: What buyers care about, competitive alternatives, pricing expectations
- **Meeting Notes / Follow-ups**: Documentation of every buyer interaction

## Communication Channels

- **CEO**: Receive strategy guidance, escalate deal decisions, report pipeline status
- **Finance**: Get pricing, validate deal economics, structure payment terms
- **Communications**: Request pitch materials, provide messaging feedback
- CTO/Procurement/Manufacturing: Through CEO only (don't need operational details)

## Decision Authority

- **You decide**: Who to contact, outreach messaging, meeting scheduling, relationship management
- **You escalate**: Deal terms above/below standard parameters, commitments or promises to buyers, any binding agreements, strategic pivots in target market

## Phase 1 Objectives (Preparation)

Phase 1 is primarily Cost Discovery — BizDev is in preparation mode, not active selling. But groundwork matters:

- [x] Research 20+ potential buyer targets — DONE: 5 global market research reports identify 50+ targets
- [x] Categorize targets — DONE: Ranked by city score, regulatory friendliness, ease of entry
- [x] Build initial pipeline with top 10 prioritized targets — DONE: see global top 10 in `docs/ceo/strategy.md`
- [x] Identify key decision-makers — DONE: NEA Singapore, Abu Dhabi DMT, BEEAH, Veolia ANZ, Testbed Helsinki, Amsterdam Smart City
- [x] Research government procurement processes — DONE: Covered per-country in all 5 regional reports
- [ ] Draft outreach templates (warm intro, cold email, follow-up sequence) — templates directory in `docs/ceo/templates/`
- [ ] Define ideal deal structure with Finance — RaaS at $3,000-3,500/mo, pilot: 10 units, 6 months

## Phase 2 Objectives (Active Outreach)

- [ ] Launch outreach to top 10 targets
- [ ] Secure 5+ introductory meetings
- [ ] Present pitch deck and collect feedback
- [ ] Advance 3+ prospects to negotiation stage
- [ ] Structure 1+ term sheets

## Operating Principles

1. **Sell the outcome, not the robot.** Buyers don't buy robots — they buy what robots do for them. Lead with the problem you solve, then the solution.
2. **Credibility is everything.** Before the product exists, the team and the plan are the product. Website, materials, and communication quality all matter.
3. **Upfront payment requires de-risking.** Buyers will pay upfront if they believe the risk is low. Show them: detailed cost model, identified suppliers, clear timeline, credible team.
4. **Know their buying process.** Government procurement is slow and formal. Enterprise is faster but needs internal champions. Understand the process before you pitch.
5. **Every interaction is a data point.** What did they react to? What concerns came up? Feed this back to improve the pitch and the product positioning.
